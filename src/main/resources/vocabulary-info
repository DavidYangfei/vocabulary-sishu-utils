Used in noun phrase addle egg (mid-13c.) "egg that does not hatch, rotten egg," lit. "urine egg," a loan-translation of L. ovum urinum, which is itself an erroneous loan-translation of Gk. ourion oon "putrid egg," lit. "wind egg," from ourios "of the wind" (confused by Roman writers with ourios "of urine," from ouron "urine").

aisle	ail	late 14c., ele, "lateral division of a church (usually separated by a row of pillars), from O.Fr. ele "wing (of a bird or an army), side of a ship" (12c., Mod.Fr. aile), from L. ala, related to axilla "wing, upper arm, armpit; wing of an army," from PIE *aks- "axis" (see axis), via a suffixed form *aks-la-. The root meaning in "turning" connects it with axle and axis.  Confused 15c. with unrelated ile "island" (perhaps from notion of a "detached" part of a church), and so it took an -s- when isle did, c.1700; by 1750 it had acquired an a-, on the model of French cognate aile. The word also was confused with alley, which gave it the sense of "passage between rows of pews or seats" (1731), which was thence extended to railway cars, theaters, etc.
akin	əˈkɪn	1550s, from phrase of kin; see kin.
alabaster	ˈæləˌbæstə	translucent whitish kind of gypsum used for vases, ornaments, and busts, late 14c., from O.Fr. alabastre (12c., Mod.Fr. albâtre), from L. alabaster "colored rock used to make boxes and vessels for unguents," from Gk. alabastros (earlier albatos) "vase for perfumes," perhaps from Egyptian 'a-labaste "vessel of the goddess Bast."

album	ˈælbəm	1650s, from L. album "white color, whiteness," neut. of albus "white" (see alb). In classical times "a blank tablet on which the Pontifex Maximus registered the principal events of the year; a list of names." Revived 16c. by German scholars whose custom was to keep an album amicorum of colleagues' signatures; meaning then expanded into "book to collect souvenirs." According to Johnson, "a book in which foreigners have long been accustomed to insert autographs of celebrated people." Photographic albums first recorded 1859. Meaning "long-playing gramophone record" is by 1951, because the sleeves they came in resembled large albums.
alchemy	ˈælkəmi:	mid-14c., from O.Fr. alchimie (14c.), alquemie (13c.), from M.L. alkimia, from Arabic al-kimiya, from Gk. khemeioa (found c.300 C.E. in a decree of Diocletian against "the old writings of the Egyptians"), all meaning "alchemy." Perhaps from an old name for Egypt (Khemia, lit. "land of black earth," found in Plutarch), or from Gk. khymatos "that which is poured out," from khein "to pour," related to khymos "juice, sap" [Klein, citing W. Muss-Arnolt, calls this folk etymology]. The word seems to have elements of both origins.Mahn ... concludes, after an elaborate investigation, that Gr. khymeia was probably the original, being first applied to pharmaceutical chemistry, which was chiefly concerned with juices or infusions of plants; that the pursuits of the Alexandrian alchemists were a subsequent development of chemical study, and that the notoriety of these may have caused the name of the art to be popularly associated with the ancient name of Egypt. [OED]The al- is the Arabic definite article, "the." The art and the name were adopted by the Arabs from Alexandrians and thence returned to Europe via Spain. Alchemy was the "chemistry" of the Middle Ages and early modern times; since c.1600 the word has been applied distinctively to the pursuit of the transmutation of baser metals into gold, which, along with the search for the universal solvent and the panacea, were the chief occupations of early chemistry.
alcohol	ˈælkəˌhɔl	"disease of alcohol addiction," 1852, from alcohol + -ism, or else from Mod.L. alcoholismus, coined in 1852 by Swedish professor of medicine Magnus Huss (1807-1890) to mean what we now would call "alcohol poisoning." In earlier times, alcoholism would have been habitual drunkenness or some such term.
alcove	ˈælˌkəʊv	1670s, "vaulted recess," from Fr. alcôve (17c.), from Sp. alcoba, from Arabic al-qobbah "the vaulted chamber," from Semitic base q-b-b "to be bent, crooked, vaulted."
ale	eɪl	O.E. ealu "ale, beer," from P.Gmc. *aluth- (cf. O.S. alo, O.N. öl), perhaps from PIE root meaning "bitter" (cf. L. alumen "alum"), or from PIE *alu-t "ale," from root *alu-, which has connotations of "sorcery, magic, possession, intoxication." The word was borrowed from Germanic into Lithuanian (alus) and Old Church Slavonic (olu). In the fifteenth century, and until the seventeenth, ale stood for the unhopped fermented malt liquor which had long been the native drink of these islands. Beer was the hopped malt liquor introduced from the Low Countires in the fifteenth century and popular first of all in the towns. By the eighteenth century, however, all malt liquor was hopped and there had been a silent mutation in the meaning of the two terms. For a time the terms became synonymous, in fact, but local habits of nomenclature still continued to perpetuate what had been a real difference: 'beer' was the malt liquor which tended to be found in towns, 'ale' was the term in general use in the country districts. [Peter Mathias, "The Brewing Industry in England," Cambridge University Press, 1959]Meaning "festival or merry-meeting at which much ale was drunk" was in Old English (see bridal).

algae	ˈældʒi:	(plural), 1794, from alga (singular), 1550s, from L. alga "seaweed," of uncertain origin, perhaps from a PIE root meaning "to putrefy, rot."
algebra	ˈældʒibrə	1550s, from M.L. algebra, from Arabic al jebr "reunion of broken parts," as in computation, used 9c. by Baghdad mathematician Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi as the title of his famous treatise on equations ("Kitab al-Jabr w'al-Muqabala" "Rules of Reintegration and Reduction"), which also introduced Arabic numerals to the West. The accent shifted 17c. from second syllable to first. The word was used in English 15c.-16c. to mean "bone-setting," probably from Arab medical men in Spain.
alias	ˈeɪli:əs	"assumed name," c.1600, from alias (adv.).
alibi	ˈæləˌbaɪ	1743, "the plea of having been elsewhere when an action took place," from L. alibi "elsewhere, somewhere else," locative of alius "(an)other" (see alias (adv.)). The weakened sense of "excuse" is attested since 1912, but technically any proof of innocence that doesn't involve being "elsewhere" is an excuse, not an alibi.
alien	ˈeiljən	mid-14c., "strange, foreign," from O.Fr. alien "alien, strange, foreign; an alien, stranger, foreigner," from L. alienus "of or belonging to another, foreign, alien, strange," also, as a noun, "a stranger, foreigner," adjectival form of alius "(an)other" (see alias).

all	ɔ:l	O.E. eall "all, every, entire," from P.Gmc. *alnaz (cf. O.Fris., O.H.G. al, O.N. allr, Goth. alls), with no certain connection outside Germanic.  Combinations with all meaning "wholly, without limit" were common in Old English (e.g. eall-halig "all-holy," eall-mihtig "all-mighty") and the method continued to form new compound words throughout the history of English. First record of all out "to one's full powers" is 1880. All-terrain vehicle first recorded 1968. All clear as a signal of "no danger" is recorded from 1902. All right, indicative of approval, is attested from 1953.
allay	əˈleɪ	O.E. alecgan "to put down, remit, give up," a Germanic compound (cf. Goth. uslagjan, O.H.G. irleccan, Ger. erlegen), from a- "down, aside" + lecgan "to lay" (see lay).  Early Middle English pronunciations of -y- and -g- were not always distinct, and the word was confused in Middle English with various senses of Romanic-derived alloy and allege, especially the latter in an obsolete sense of "to lighten," from L. ad- "to" + levis (see lever). Amid the overlapping of meanings that thus arose, there was developed a perplexing network of uses of allay and allege, that belong entirely to no one of the original vbs., but combine the senses of two or more of them. [OED]The double -l- is 17c., a mistaken Latinism. Related: Allayed; allaying.

Cf. sense evolution of gate. Applied by c.1500 to "long narrow enclosure for playing at bowls, skittles, etc." Used in place names from c.1500.  The word is applied in Amer.Eng. to what in London is called a mews, and also is used there especially of a back-lane parallel to a main street (1729). To be up someone's alley "in someone's neighborhood" (literally or figuratively) is from 1931; alley-cat attested by 1890.
alliance	əˈlaiəns	c.1300, "bond of marriage" (between ruling houses or noble families), from O.Fr. aliance (12c., Mod.Fr. alliance) "alliance, bond; marriage, union," from aliier (Mod.Fr. allier) "combine, unite" (see ally). As a bond or treaty between rulers, late 14c.

allure	əˈljuə	c.1400, from Anglo-Fr. alurer, O.Fr. aleurer "to attract, captivate; train a falcon to hunt," from à "to" (see ad-) + loirre "falconer's lure," from a Frankish word (see lure), perhaps influenced by Fr. allure "gait, way of walking." Related: Allured; alluring. The noun is first attested 1540s; properly this sense is allurement.
allurement	əˈljʊəmənt	1540s, "means of alluring;" see allure + -ment. Meaning "act of alluring" is recorded from 1560s.
alluring	əˈljuəriŋ	1530s, "action of attracting," verbal noun from allure (v.).
allusion	əˈlu:ʒən	1540s, from L. allusionem (nom. allusio) "a playing with, a reference to," noun of action from pp. stem of alludere (see allude). An allusion is never an outright or explicit mention of the person or thing the speaker seems to have in mind.

almond	ˈɑ:mənd	c.1300, from O.Fr. almande, amande, from V.L. *amendla, *amandula, from L. amygdala (pl.), from Gk. amygdalos "an almond tree," of unknown origin, perhaps a Semitic word. Altered in Medieval Latin by influence of amandus "loveable," and acquiring in French an excrescent -l- perhaps from Sp. almendra "almond," which got it via confusion with the Arabic definite article al-, which formed the beginnings of many Spanish words. Applied to eyes shaped like almonds, especially of certain Asiatic peoples, from 1870.
alms	ɑ:mz	O.E. ælmesse "alms, almsgiving," from P.Gmc. *alemosna (cf. O.S. alamosna, O.H.G. alamuosan, O.N. ölmusa), an early borrowing of V.L. *alemosyna (cf. O.Sp. almosna, O.Fr. almosne, It. limosina), from Church L. eleemosyna (Tertullian, 3c.), from Gk. eleemosyne "pity, mercy," in Ecclesiastical Greek "charity, alms," from eleemon "compassionate," from eleos "pity, mercy," of unknown origin, perhaps imitative of cries for alms. Spelling perversion in Vulgar Latin is perhaps by influence of alimonia.
almshouse	ˈɑ:mzˌhaʊs	mid-15c., from alms + house (n.).
aloft	əˈlɔ:ft	c.1200, from a Scandinavian source, cf. O.N. a lopti "up above," lit. "up in the air," from a "in, on" + lopt "sky, air, atmosphere; loft, upper room" (cf. Goth. luftus, O.H.G. luft, O.E. lyft "air;" see loft).

aloof	əˈlu:f	1530s, from a- (1) + M.E. loof "weather gage," also "windward direction," probably from Du. loef (M.Du. lof) "the weather side of a ship." Originally a nautical order to keep the ship's head to the wind, thus to stay clear of a lee-shore or some other quarter; hence the figurative sense of "at a distance, apart" (1580s). Related: Aloofly; aloofness.
alphabet	ˈælfəbit	1570s, from L.L. alphabetum (Tertullian), from Gk. alphabetos, from alpha + beta. Alphabet soup first attested 1907. Words for it in Old English included stæfræw, lit. "row of letters," stæfrof "array of letters."

alpine	ˈælˌpaɪn	"of the Alps," early 15c., from L. Alpinus; see Alp. Earlier was Alpish (1590s).
altar	ˈɔ:ltə	O.E. alter, altar, from L. altare (pl. altaria) "high altar, altar for sacrifice to the great gods," perhaps originally meaning "burnt offerings" (cf. L. adolere "to worship, to offer sacrifice, to honor by burning sacrifices to"), but influenced by L. altus "high." In Middle English, often auter, from O.Fr. auter. Reintroduced from Latin 1500s. As a symbol of marriage, by 1820.
alter	ˈɔ:ltə	late 14c., "to change (something)," from O.Fr. alterer "change, alter," from M.L. alterare "to change," from L. alter "the other (of the two)," from PIE *al- "beyond" (see alias (adv.)) + comparative suffix -ter (cf. other). Intransitive sense "to become otherwise" first recorded 1580s. Related: Altered; altering.
alteration	ˌɔ:ltəˈreɪʃən	late 14c., "action of altering," from O.Fr. alteracion (14c.) "change, alteration," and directly from M.L. alterationem (nom. alteratio), noun of action from pp. stem of L.L. alterare (see alter). Meaning "change in character or appearance" is from 1530s; that of "change in ready-made clothes to suit a customer's specifications" is from 1901. Related: Alterations.

altitude	ˈæltitju:d	late 14c., from L. altitudinem (nom. altitudo) "height, altitude," from altus "high" (see old).
alto	ˈæltəʊ	1784, "man with an alto voice," from It. alto (canto), from L. altus "high" (see old). Originally a "high" man's voice, now more commonly applied to the lower range of women's voices (which is more strictly the contralto), an extension first recorded in 1881.  The alto in a man is totally distinct from the contralto in a woman. The tone is utterly different -- the best notes of the one are certainly not the best notes of the other; and although in certain cases a contralto may sing with good effect music written for a male alto (e.g. in some oratorios), yet the converse is scarcely ever true. ["How to Sing," 1890]  As a type of saxophone, from 1869.
altruism	ˈæltru:ˌɪzəm	1853, "unselfishness, opposite of egoism," from Fr. altruisme, coined or popularized 1830 by French philosopher Auguste Comte (1798-1857), from autrui, from O.Fr. altrui, "of or to others," from L. alteri, dative of alter "other" (see alter). Apparently suggested to Comte by French legal phrase l'autrui, or in full, le bien, le droit d'autrui. The -l- is perhaps a reinsertion from the Latin word.  There is a fable that when the badger had been stung all over by bees, a bear consoled him by a rhapsodic account of how he himself had just breakfasted on their honey. The badger replied peevishly, "The stings are in my flesh, and the sweetness is on your muzzle." The bear, it is said, was surprised at the badger's want of altruism. ["George Eliot," "Theophrastus Such," 1879] 
altruistic	ˌæltruˈistik	1853, from Fr. altruiste (adj.), from altruisme (see altruism) + -ic.
aluminium	ˌælju:-ˈminjəm	see aluminum.
aluminum	əˈlu:mənəm	1812, coined by English chemist Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829), from alumina, name given 18c. to aluminum oxide, from L. alumen "alum" (see alum). Davy originally called it alumium (1808), then amended this to aluminum, which remains the U.S. word, but British editors in 1812 further amended it to aluminium, the modern preferred British form, to better harmonize with other metallic element names (sodium, potassium, etc.).Aluminium, for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word, in preference to aluminum, which has a less classical sound. ["Quarterly Review," 1812] 
alumni	əˈlʌmnaɪ	see alumnus.

amateurish	ˌæməˈtɜ:rɪʃ	1863; from amateur + -ish. Related: Amateurishly; amateurishness.
amaze	əˈmeiz	1590s, "mental stupefaction," early use of the Latin suffix with a native verb, from amaze + -ment. Meaning "overwhelming wonder" is c.1600.
amazon	 	late 14c., from Gk. Amazon (mostly in plural Amazones) "one of a race of female warriors in Scythia," probably from an unknown non-I.E. word, possibly from an Iranian compound *ha-maz-an- "(one) fighting together" [Watkins], but in folk etymology long derived from a- "without" + mazos "breasts," hence the story that the Amazons cut or burned off one breast so they could draw bowstrings more efficiently. The river in South America (originally called by the Sp. Rio Santa Maria de la Mar Dulce) rechristened by Francisco de Orellana, 1541, after an encounter with female warriors of the Tapuyas (or, as some say, beardless, long-haired male tribesmen; still others hold that the name is a corruption of a native word in Tupi or Guarani meaning "wave").
ambassador	æmˈbæsədə	1759, from ambassador + -al (1).
amber	ˈæmbə	mid-14c., "ambergris, perfume made from ambergris," from O.Fr. ambre, from M.L. ambar "ambergris," from Arabic 'anbar "ambergris." In Europe, the sense was extended, inexplicably, to fossil resins from the Baltic (late 13c. in Anglo-Latin; c.1400 in English), which has become the main sense as the use of ambergris has waned. This formerly was known as white or yellow amber to distinguish it from ambergris, which word entered English early 15c. from French, which distinguished the two substances as ambre gris and amber jaune. The classical word for Baltic amber was electrum (cf. electric).
ambidextrous	ˌæmbɪˈdekstrəs	1640s, with -ous, from ambidexter (adj.) "double-dealing" (1610s), from Fr. ambidextre or directly from L. ambidexter, lit. "right-handed on both sides," from ambi- "both" (see ambi-) + dexter "right-handed" (see dexterity). Its opposite, ambilevous "left-handed on both sides, clumsy" (1640s) is rare. Ambidexter as a noun, "one who takes bribes from both sides," is attested from 1530s and is the earliest form of the word in English; its sense of "one who uses both hands equally well" appears by 1590s.

"to wander," from ambi- "about" (see ambi-) + agere "drive, lead, act" (see act). Sir Thomas More (1528) seems to have first used it in English, but ambiguity dates back to c.1400. Related: Ambiguously; ambiguousness.
ambition	æmˈbiʃən	mid-14c., from M.Fr. ambition or directly from L. ambitionem (nom. ambitio) "a going around," especially to solicit votes, hence "a striving for favor, courting, flattery; a desire for honor, thirst for popularity," noun of action from pp. stem of ambire "to go around" (see ambient). Rarely used in the literal sense in English, where it carries the secondary Latin sense of "eager or inordinate desire of honor or preferment." In early use always pejorative, of inordinate or overreaching desire; ambition was grouped with pride and vainglory.
ambitious	æmˈbiʃəs	late 14c., from L. ambitiosus "going around to canvass for office," from ambitio (see ambition). Related: Ambitiously.
ambivalence	æmˈbɪvələns	"simultaneous conflicting feelings," 1924 (1912 as ambivalency), from Ger. Ambivalenz, coined 1910 by Swiss psychologist Eugen Bleuler (1857-1939) on model of Ger. Equivalenz "equivalence," etc., from L. ambi- "both" (see ambi-) + valentia "strength," from prp. of valere "be strong" (see valiant).

ambulance	ˈæmbjuləns	1809, "mobile or field hospital," from Fr. (hôpital) ambulant, lit. "walking (hospital)," from L. ambulantem (nom. ambulans), prp. of ambulare "to walk" (see amble). The word was not common in English until the meaning transferred from "field hospital" to "vehicle for conveying wounded from field" (1854) during the Crimean War. In late 19c. U.S. the word was used dialectally to mean "prairie wagon." Ambulance-chaser as a contemptuous term for a type of lawyer dates from 1897.

ambush	ˈæmbʊʃ	late 15c., embushe, from the English verb or from M.Fr. embusche, from O.Fr. embuscher (see ambush (v.)). Earlier was ambushment (late 14c.). Figurative use by 1590s.

"not intoxicating," from a- "not" + methyskein "make drunk," from methys "wine" (see mead (n.1)); based on the stone's ancient reputation for preventing drunkenness, which was perhaps sympathetic magic suggested by its wine-like color. People wore rings made of it before drinking. Spelling restored from Middle English ametist.
amiable	ˈeimjəbl	mid-14c., from O.Fr. amiable, from L.L. amicabilis "friendly," from amicus "friend," related to amare "to love" (see Amy). The form confused in Old French with amable "lovable," from L. amare. Reborrowed later in proper Latin form as amicable.

The shrine was ancient already in Augustus' day, and the salts were prepared "from the sands where the camels waited while their masters prayed for good omens" [Shipley]. There also was a gum form of sal ammoniac, from a wild plant that grew near the shrine, and across North Africa and Asia. A less likely theory traces the name to Gk. Armeniakon "Armenian," since the substance also was found in Armenia. Also known as spirit of hartshorn and volatile or animal alkali.

amnesty	ˈæmnɪsti:	"pardon of past offenses," 1570s, from Fr. amnestie "intentional overlooking," from L. amnestia, from Gk. amnestia "forgetfulness (of wrong); an amnesty," from a-, privative prefix, "not," + mnestis "remembrance," related to mnaomai "I remember" (see mind (n.)).

Yonde in Ethiopia ben the Antipodes, men that haue theyr fete ayenst our fete. ["De Proprietatibus Rerum Bartholomeus Anglicus," translated by John of Trevisa, 1398] Not to be confused with antiscii "those who live on the same meridian on opposite side of the equator," whose shadows fall at noon in the opposite direction, from Gk. anti- + skia "shadow." Related: Antipodal (adj.); antipodean (1630s, n.; 1650s, adj.). 
antipsychotic	ˌænti:saɪˈkɔtɪk	 
antiquated	ˈæntɪˌkweɪtɪd	1620s, pp. adjective from antiquate (1530s) "to make old or obsolete," from L. antiquatus, pp. of antiquare (see antique). An older adjective in the same sense was antiquate (early 15c.), from Latin.

Specific reference to ancient Greece and Rome is from mid-15c.; meaning "quality of being old" is from about the same time. Antiquities "relics of ancient days" is from 1510s.

"a placing against," also a term in logic and rhetoric, noun of action from antitithenai "to set against, oppose," a term in logic, from anti- "against" (see anti-) + tithenai "to place," from PIE root *dhe- "to put, to do" (see factitious).

antler	ˈæntlə	late 14c., from Anglo-Fr. auntiler,  O.Fr. antoillier (14c., Mod.Fr. andouiller) "antler," perhaps from Gallo-Romance cornu *antoculare "horn in front of the eyes," from L. ante "before" (see ante) + ocularis "of the eyes" (see ocular). This etymology is doubted by some because no similar word exists in any other Romance language, but cf. Ger. Augensprossen "antlers," lit. "eye-sprouts," for a similar formation.
antonym	ˈæntənim	1867, coined to serve as opposite of synonym, from Gk. anti- "equal to, instead of, opposite" (see anti-) + -onym "name" (see name (n.)). Perhaps introduced to English in the book "Synonyms and Antonyms" (1867) by the Ven. C.J. Smith, M.A.  UNDER the head of Synonyms and Antonyms, Archdeacon Smith arranges words which form an antithesis to one another. The word "antonym" is, we believe, a new formation but useful. ["Journal of Sacred Literature," July 1867]   Fr. antonyme (1842), Ger. antonym (by 1859) are older. The un-Greek alternative counterterm has been left to fade.
anvil	ˈænvɪl	O.E. anfilt, a West Germanic compound (cf. M.Du. anvilt, O.H.G. anafalz, Du. aanbeeld, Dan. ambolt "anvil") from *ana- "on" + *filtan "hit" (see felt (n.)). The ear bone so called from 1680s. Anvil Chorus is based on the "Gypsy Song" that opens Act II of Giuseppe Verdi's opera "Il Trovatore," first performed in Teatro Apollo, Rome, Jan. 19, 1853.

anyhow	ˈenihau	1740, from any + how (adv.). Unlike the cases of most other any + (interrogative) compounds, there is no record of it in Old or Middle English. Emphatic form any old how is recorded from 1900, American English.
aorta	eɪˈɔ:tə	1570s, from M.L. aorta, from Gk. aorte, term applied by Aristotle to the great artery of the heart, lit. "what is hung up," from aeirein "to lift, heave, raise," of uncertain origin; related to the second element in meteor. Used earlier by Hippocrates of the bronchial tubes. Related: Aortal; aortic.

Originally a positive quality; sense of "indolence of mind, indifference to what should excite" is from c.1733.
ape	eip	O.E. apa "ape, monkey," from P.Gmc. *apan (cf. O.S. apo, O.N. api, Du. aap, Ger. affe), perhaps borrowed in Proto-Germanic from Celtic (cf. O.Ir. apa) or Slavic (cf. O.Bohemian op, Slovak opitza), perhaps ultimately from a non-Indo-European language.  Apes were noted in medieval times for mimicry of human action, hence, perhaps, the other figurative use of the word, to mean "a fool." To go ape (in emphatic form, go apeshit) "go crazy" is 1955, U.S. slang. To lead apes in hell (1570s) was the fancied fate of one who died an old maid.
apectator	spekˈteitə	 
aperiodic	ˌeɪpɪəi:ˈɔdɪk	1874, from a-, privative prefix, + periodic.
aperitif	əˌperˈti:f	1894, "alcoholic drink taken before a meal to stimulate the appetite," from Fr. apéritif "laxative, laxative liqueur," lit. "opening," from L. aperitivus, from aperire "to open" (see overt). Cf. Middle English apertive (adj.), a medical word meaning "capable of opening or dilating" (pores, etc.), early 15c.
aperture	ˈæpətʃə	early 15c., from L. apertura "an opening," from apertus, pp. of aperire "to open" (see overt).
apex	ˈeɪpeks	c.1600, from L. apex "summit, peak, tip, top, extreme end;" probably related to apere "to fasten, fix," hence "the tip of anything" (one of the meanings in Latin was "small rod at the top of the flamen's cap"), from PIE *ap- "to take, reach." Proper plural is apices.
aphasia	əˈfeɪʒə	"loss of ability to speak," especially as result of brain injury or disorder, 1867, from Mod.L. aphasia, from Gk. aphasia "speechlessness," from a- "without" (see a- (3)) + phasis "utterance," from phanai "to speak," related to pheme "voice, report, rumor" (see fame).  APHASIA is the term which has recently been given to the loss of the faculty of articulate language, the organs of phonation and of articulation, as well as the intelligence, being unimpaired. The pathology of this affection is at the present time the subject of much discussion in the scientific world; the French Academy devoted several of their séances during the year 1865 to its special elucidation, and the Medical Journals of France and of our own country have lately contained a good deal of original matter bearing upon this obscure feature in cerebral pathology. [Frederic Bateman, M.D., "Aphasia," London, 1868] 
aphorism	ˈæfəˌrɪzəm	1520s (especially in reference to the "Aphorisms of Hippocrates"), from M.Fr. aphorisme (14c., aufforisme), from L.L. aphorismus, from Gk. aphorismos "definition, pithy sentence," from aphorizein "to mark off, divide," from apo- "from" (see apo-) + horizein "to bound."  An aphorism is a short, pithy statement containing a truth of general import; an axiom is a statement of self-evident truth; a theorem is a demonstrable proposition in science or mathematics; an epigram is like an aphorism, but lacking in general import. Maxim and saying can be used as synonyms for aphorism.

Adjective forms are apogeal, apogean.
apolitical	ˌeɪpəˈlɪtɪkəl	1947, from a- "not" (see a- (3)) + political.

apology	əˈpɔlədʒi	early 15c., "defense, justification," from L.L. apologia, from Gk. apologia "a speech in defense," from apologeisthai "to speak in one's defense," from apologos "an account, story," from apo- "from, off" (see apo-) + logos "speech" (see lecture).  The original English sense of "self-justification" yielded a meaning "frank expression of regret for wrong done," first recorded 1590s, but this was not the main sense until 18c. The old sense tends to emerge in Latin form apologia (first attested in English 1784), especially since J.H. Newman's "Apologia pro Vita Sua" (1864).
apoplectic	ˌæpəˈplektɪk	1610s, "involving apoplexy," from Fr. apoplectique (16c.), from L. apoplecticus, from Gk. apoplektikos "disabled by a stroke, crippled, struck dumb," from apoplektos, verbal adjective of apoplessein (see apoplexy). Meaning "showing symptoms of apoplexy" (1721) gradually shaded into "enraged, very angry."

The Latin translation, sideratio, means "disease caused by a constellation."
apostasy	əˈpɔstəsi:	late 14c., "renunciation, abandonment or neglect of established religion," from L. apostasia, from later Gk. apostasia, from apostasis "revolt, defection," lit. "a standing off" (see apostate). General (non-religious) sense is attested from 1570s.
apostate	əˈpɔsˌteɪt	late 14c.; see apostate (adj.).
apostrophe	əˈpɔstrəfi:	mark indicating omitted letter, 1580s, from M.Fr. apostrophe, from L.L. apostrophus, from Gk. apostrophos (prosoidia) "(the accent of) turning away," thus, a mark showing where a letter has been omitted, from apostrephein "avert, turn away," from apo- "from" (see apo-) + strephein "to turn" (see strophe).  In English, the mark often represents loss of -e- in -es, possessive ending. It was being extended to all possessives, whether they ever had an -e- or not, by 18c. Greek also used this word for a "turning aside" of an orator in speech to address some individual, a sense first recorded in English 1530s.
apothecary	əˈpɔθɪˌkeri:	mid-14c., "shopkeeper, especially one who stores, compounds, and sells medicaments," from O.Fr. apotecaire (13c., Mod.Fr. apothicaire), from L.L. apothecarius "storekeeper," from L. apotheca "storehouse," from Gk. apotheke "barn, storehouse," lit. "a place where things are put away," from apo- "away" (see apo-) + tithenai "to put," from PIE root *dhe- "to put, to do" (see factitious). Same root produced Fr. boutique and Sp. bodega. Cognate compounds produced Skt. apadha- "concealment," O.Pers. apadana- "palace."  Drugs and herbs being among the chief items of non-perishable goods, the meaning narrowed 17c. to "druggist" (Apothecaries' Company of London separated from the Grocers' in 1617). Apothecaries formerly were notorious for "the assumed gravity and affectation of knowledge generally put on by the gentlemen of this profession, who are commonly as superficial in their learning as they are pedantic in their language" [Francis Grose, "A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue," 1796]. Hence, Apothecary's Latin, barbarously mangled, also known as Dog Latin. 
apothegm	ˈæpəuθem	"pithy saying," 1550s, from Gk. apophthegma "terse, pointed saying," lit. "something clearly spoken," from apophthengesthai "to speak one's opinion plainly," from apo- "from" (see apo-) + phthengesthai "to utter." See aphorism for nuances of usage. Spelling apophthegm, restored by Johnson, is preferred in England, according to OED.
apotheosis	əˌpɔθi:ˈəʊsɪs	1600s, from L.L. apotheosis "deification," from Gk. apotheosis, from apotheoun "deify, make (someone) a god," from apo- special use of this prefix, meaning, here, "change" + theos "god" (see Thea).

Meaning "ghost" first recorded c.1600; the shade of sense differentiation between appearance and apparition is that the latter tends to be unexpected or startling.

artificial	ˌɑ:tiˈfiʃəl	late 14c., in the phrase artificial day "part of the day from sunrise to sunset," from O.Fr. artificial, from L. artificialis "of or belonging to art," from artificium (see artifice). Meaning "made by man" (opposite of natural) is from early 15c. Applied to things that are not natural, whether real (artificial light) or not (artificial flowers). Artificial insemination dates from 1897. Artificial intelligence "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines" was coined in 1956.
artillery	ɑ:ˈtiləri	late 14c., "warlike munitions," from Anglo-Fr. artillerie, O.Fr. artillerie (14c.), from artillier "to provide with engines of war" (13c.), which probably is from M.L. articulum "art, skill," diminutive of L. ars (gen. artis) "art." But some would connect it with L. articulum "joint," and still others with O.Fr. atillier "to equip," altered by influence of arte. Sense of "engines for discharging missiles" (catapults, slings, bows, etc.) is from late 15c.; that of "ordnance, large guns" is from 1530s.
artisan	ˈɑ:tɪzən	1859, from artisan (n.).
artist	ˈɑ:tist	1819 in English, from 1804 as a French word, from Fr. artiste; a reborrowing of artist, at first in a foreign context, later used to fill the gap after the sense of artist had become limited toward the visual arts and especially painting.  Artiste: an admirable word (albeit somewhat Frenchified) of late applied, with nice discrimination, to every species of exhibitor, from a rope-dancer down to a mere painter or sculptor. On looking into little Entick (my great authority in these matters), I find we have already the word artist; but with stupid English perversity, we have hitherto used that in a much more restricted sense than its newly-imported rival, which it is becoming the excellent fashion to adopt. ["Paul Pry's Journal of a Residence at Little-Pedlington," Philadelphia, 1836]
artistry	ˈɑ:tistri	"artistic ability," 1837, from artist + -ry; as chemistry from chemist, etc.
artless	ˈɑ:tlɪs	1580s, "unskillful," from art (n.) + -less. Later also "uncultured" (1590s); then "unartificial, natural" (1670s) and "guileless, ingenuous" (1714). Related: Artlessly; artlessness. 
as	æz	c.1200, worn-down form of O.E. alswa "quite so" (see also), fully established by c.1400. Equivalent to so; any distinction in use is purely idiomatic.

Interjection of incredulity as if! (i.e. "as if that really could happen") is attested from 1995.

as-yet-unexploited	 	 
ascend	əˈsend	late 14c., ascendent, astrological use is earliest, from M.Fr. ascendant (n., adj.) and directly from L. ascendentem (nom. ascendans), prp. of ascendere "to mount, ascend, go up" (see ascend). Sense "moving upward, rising" is recorded from 1590s. In the ascendant "ruling, dominant" (not, as is often thought, "rising") is from 1670s.
ascendancy	əˈsendənsi:	1712; see ascendant + -cy.
ascendent	əˈsendənt	late 14c., ascendent, astrological use is earliest, from M.Fr. ascendant (n., adj.) and directly from L. ascendentem (nom. ascendans), prp. of ascendere "to mount, ascend, go up" (see ascend).

ascribe	əsˈkraib	mid-14c., ascrive, from O.Fr. ascrivre "to inscribe; attribute, impute," from L. ascribere "to write in, to add to in a writing," from ad- "to" (see ad-) + scribere "to write" (see script). Spelling restored by 16c. Related: Ascribed; ascribing.
aseptic	əˈseptɪk	1859 (adj.), 1884 (n.), from a- (2) "not" + septic.
ashamed	əˈʃeimd	O.E. asceamed "feeling shame, filled with shame," pp. of ascamian "to feel shame," from a- intensive prefix + scamian "to put to shame" (see shame (v.)). The verb is obsolete, but the pp. lives on. Meaning "reluctant through fear of shame" is c.1300.
asinine	ˈæsəˌnaɪn	c.1600, "obstinate, stupid," from L. asininus "stupid," lit. "like an ass," from asinus "ass," also "dolt, blockhead" (see ass (1)). The literal sense in English is recorded from 1620s.
askance	əˈskæns	1520s, "sideways, asquint," of obscure origin. OED has separate listings for askance and obsolete M.E. askance(s) and no indication of a connection, but Barnhart and others derive the newer word from the older one. The M.E. word, recorded early 14c. as ase quances and found later in Chaucer, meant âin such a way that; even as; as if;â and as an adverb âinsincerely, deceptively.â It has been analyzed as a compound of as and O.Fr. quanses (pronounced âkansesâ) âhow if,â from L. quam "how" + si "if."  The E[nglish] as is, accordingly, redundant, and merely added by way of partial explanation. The M.E. askances means "as if" in other passages, but here means, "as if it were," i.e. "possibly," "perhaps"; as said above. Sometimes the final s is dropped .... [Walter W. Skeat, glossary to Chaucerâs âMan of Lawâs Tale,â 1894]  Also see discussion in Leo Spitzer, "Anglo-French Etymologies," Philological Quarterly 24.23 (1945), and see OED entry for askance (adv.) for discussion of the mysterious ask- word cluster in English. Other guesses about the origin of askance include O.Fr. a escone, from pp. of a word for "hidden;" It. a scancio "obliquely, slantingly;" or that it is a cognate of askew.
askew	əˈskju:	1570s, of uncertain etymology; perhaps lit. "on skew" (see skew), or from the Old Norse form, a ska. Earlier askoye is attested in the same sense (early 15c.).
asparagus	əˈspærəgəs	late O.E. sparage, from L. asparagus (in M.L. often sparagus), from Gk. asparagos, of uncertain origin; probably from PIE root *sp(h)er(e)g- "to spring up" (though perhaps from a non-Greek source). In Middle English, asperages sometimes was regarded as a plural, with false singular aspergy. By 16c. the word had been anglicized as far as sperach, sperage. It was respelled by c.1600 to conform with classical Latin, but then folk-etymologized formation sparrowgrass arose 17c., persisting into 19c., during which time asparagus had "an air of stiffness and pedantry" [John Walker, "Critical Pronouncing Dictionary," 1791]. Known in O.E. as eorðnafela.
aspect	ˈæspekt	late 14c., an astrological term, "relative position of the planets as they appear from earth" (i.e., how they "look on" one another); later also "way of viewing things," from L. aspectus "seeing, looking, appearance," from pp. of aspicere "to look at," from ad- "to" (see ad-) + specere "to look" (see scope (1)). Meaning "the look one wears, the appearance of things" attested by early 15c.
aspen	ˈæspən	late 14c., from adjective or genitive form of O.E. æspe "aspen tree, white poplar," from P.Gmc. *aspo (cf. O.N. ösp, M.Du. espe, O.H.G. aspa, Ger. Espe), from PIE *apsa "aspen" (cf. Lith. opuse). The current form in English probably arose from phrases such as aspen leaf, aspen bark. Its leaves have been figurative of tremulousness and quaking since at least early 15c.
asperity	æˈsperɪti:	c.1200, asprete "hardship," "harshness of feelings," a figurative use, from O.Fr. asperité "difficulty, painful situation, harsh treatment" (12c., Mod.Fr. âpreté), from L. asperitatem (nom. asperitas) "roughness," from asper "rough, harsh," of unknown origin; in Latin used also of sour wine, bad weather, and hard times. Figurative meaning "harshness of feeling" attested from early 15c.

asphalt	ˈæsˌfɔ:lt	early 14c., "hard, resinous mineral pitch found originally in Biblical lands," from L.L. asphaltum, from Gk. asphaltos "asphalt, bitumen," probably from a non-Greek source, possibly Semitic [Klein, citing Lewy, 1895]. Another theory holds it to be from Gk. a- "not" + *sphaltos "able to be thrown down," taken as verbal adj. of sphallein "to throw down," in reference to a use of the material in building. Meaning "paving composition" dates from 1847 and its popular use in this sense established the modern form of the English word, mostly displacing asphaltum, asphaltos. As a verb meaning "to cover with asphalt," from 1872.
asphyxia	æsˈfɪksi:ə	1706, "stoppage of pulse," from Modern Latin, from Gk. asphyxia "stopping of the pulse," from a- "not" + sphyzein "to throb." The current sense of "suffocation" is from 1778, but it is a "curious infelicity of etymology" [OED] since victims of suffocation have a pulse for some time after breathing has stopped.
asphyxiate	æsˈfɪksi:ˌeɪt	1818, "to suffocate" (someone or something), from asphyxia + -ate (2). Related: Asphyxiated; asphyxiating.

The notion is of "panting with desire," or perhaps of rising smoke. Related: Aspired; aspiring.
aspirin	ˈæspərɪn	coined 1899 (H. Dresser) in German as a trademark name, from Gk. a- "without" + L. Spiraea (ulmaria) "meadow-sweet," the plant in whose flowers or leaves the processed acid in the medicine is found naturally, + chemical ending -in (see -ine (2)). "Hence aspirin prop. means 'acetylo-salicylic acid which is gained not from the Spiraea ulmaria (but in a chemical way)' " [Klein]. Or the whole might be a contraction of acetylierte spirsäure, the German name of the acid [Flood], which now is obsolete, replaced by salicylic acid.
assail	əˈseɪl	c.1200, from O.Fr. assalir "attack, assault, assail" (12c., Mod.Fr. assaillir), from V.L. *adsalire "to leap at," from L. ad- "at" (see ad-) + salire "to leap" (see salient). Figurative use from mid-14c. Related: Assailed; assailing; assailable.

So literally "an inviolable place." General sense of "safe or secure place" is from 1640s; meaning "benevolent institution to shelter some class of persons" is from 1776.
asymmetric	ˌæsɪˈmetrɪk	1680s; see asymmetry + -ical. Other forms that have served as an adjective based on asymmetry are asymmetral (1620s), asymmetrous (1660s), and asymmetric (1875); only the last seems to have any currency. Related: Asymmetrically.

atheism	ˈeɪθi:ˌɪzəm	1580s, from Fr. athéisme (16c.), from Gk. atheos "without god" (see atheist). A slightly earlier form is represented by atheonism (1530s) which is perhaps from It. atheo "atheist." Ancient Gk. atheotes meant "ungodliness."
atheistic	ˌeiθiˈistik	1630s, from atheist + -ic. Atheistical attested from c.1600.
athlete	ˈæθli:t	early 15c., from L. athleta "a wrestler, athlete, combatant in public games," from Gk. athletes "prizefighter, contestant in the games," agent noun from athlein "to contest for a prize," related to athlos "a contest" and athlon "a prize," of unknown origin.

A picture of the Titan Atlas holding up the world appeared on the frontispiece of this and other early map collections.

Greek atmos is from PIE *awet-mo-, from root *wet- "to blow, inspire, spiritually arouse" (see wood (adj.)). First used in English in connection with the Moon, which, as it turns out, doesn't have one. It is observed in the solary eclipses, that there is sometimes a great trepidation about the body of the moon, from which we may likewise argue an atmosphaera, since we cannot well conceive what so probable a cause there should be of such an appearance as this, Quod radii solares a vaporibus lunam ambitntibus fuerint intercisi, that the sun-beams were broken and refracted by the vapours that encompassed the moon. [Rev. John Wilkins, "Discovery of New World or Discourse tending to prove that it probable there may be another World in the Moon,"  1638]   Figurative sense of "surrounding influence, mental or moral environment" is c.1800.

attachment	əˈtætʃmənt	c.1400, "arrest of a person on judicial warrant" (mid-13c. in Anglo-Latin), from Fr. attachement, from attacher (see attach). Application to property (including, later, wages) dates from 1590s; meaning "sympathy, devotion" is recorded from 1704; that of "something that is attached to something else" dates from 1797 and has become perhaps the most common use since the rise of e-mail.
attack	əˈtæk	c.1600, from Fr. attaquer (16c.), from Florentine Italian attaccare (battaglia) "join (battle)," thus the word is a doublet of attach, which was used 15c.-17c. also in the sense now reserved to attack. Related: Attacked; attacking. The noun is 1660s, from the verb; cf. M.E. attach "a seizure or attack" (of fever), late 14c.
attain	əˈtein	c.1300, "to succeed in reaching," from stem of O.Fr. ataindre (11c., Mod.Fr. atteindre) "to come up to, reach, attain, endeavor, strive," from V.L. *adtangere, from L. attingere "to touch, to arrive at," from ad- "to" (see ad-) + tangere "to touch" (see tangent). Latin attingere had a wide range of meanings, including "to attack, to strike, to appropriate, to manage," all somehow suggested by the literal sense "to touch." Related: Attained; attaining.
attainment	əˈteɪnmənt	late 14c., "encroachment" (a sense now obsolete), from O.Fr. ataignement (Mod.Fr. atteignement), from ataindre; see attain. Meaning "action of attaining" is from 1540s; sense of "that which is attained, personal accomplishment" dates from 1670s.

attic	ˈætik	"top story under the roof of a house," 1855, shortened from attic storey (1724). The term Attic order in classical architecture meant a small, square decorative column of the type often used in a low story above a building's main facade, a feature associated with the region around Athens (see Attic). The word then was applied to "a low decorative facade above the main story of a building" (1690s in English), and it came to mean the space enclosed by such a structure. The modern use is via French. attique. "An attic is upright, a garret is in a sloping roof" [Weekley].
atticulate	ɑ:ˈtikjulit	 
attire	əˈtaɪə	c.1300, "equipment of a man-at-arms; fine apparel," from attire (v.).
attorney	əˈtə:ni	early 14c. (mid-13c. in Anglo-Latin), from O.Fr. atorné "(one) appointed," pp. of aturner "to decree, assign, appoint," from atorner (see attorn). The legal Latin form attornare influenced the spelling in Anglo-French. The sense is of "one appointed to represent another's interests." In English law, a private attorney was one appointed to act for another in business or legal affairs (usually for pay); an attorney at law or public attorney was a qualified legal agent in the courts of Common Law who prepared the cases for a barrister, who pleaded them (the equivalent of a solicitor in Chancery). So much a term of contempt in England that it was abolished by the Judicature Act of 1873 and merged with solicitor.Johnson observed that "he did not care to speak ill of any man behind his back, but he believed the gentleman was an attorney." [Boswell]The double -t- is a mistaken 15c. attempt to restore a non-existent Latin original. Attorney general first recorded 1530s in sense of "legal officer of the state" (late 13c. in Anglo-French), from French, hence the odd plural (subject first, adjective second).
attractive	əˈtræktiv	late 14c., "absorptive," from M.Fr. attractif (14c.), from attract-, pp. stem of attrahere (see attract). Meaning "having the quality of drawing people's eye or interest" is from 1580s; sense of "pleasing, alluring" is from c.1600. Related: Attractively; attractiveness.

"a rubbing against," noun of action from pp. stem of atterere "to wear, rub away," figuratively "to destroy, waste," from ad- "to" (see ad-) + terere "to rub" (see throw). The earliest sense in English is from Scholastic theology (late 14c.), "sorrow for sin merely out of fear of punishment," a minor irritation, and thus less than contrition. The sense of "wearing down of military strength" is a World War I coinage (1914). Figurative use by 1930.

augur	ˈɔ:gə	1540s, from L. augur, a religious official in ancient Rome who foretold events by interpreting omens, perhaps originally meaning "an increase in crops enacted in ritual," in which case it probably is from Old L. *augos (gen. *augeris) "increase," and is related to augere "increase" (see augment). The more popular theory is that it is from L. avis "bird," since the flights, singing, and feeding of birds, along with entrails from bird sacrifices, were important objects of divination (cf. auspicious). In that case, the second element would be from garrire "to talk." The verb is c.1600, from the noun. Related: Augured; auguring.

O.H.G. bannan "to command or forbid under threat of punishment," Ger. bannen "banish, expel, curse"), originally "to speak publicly," from PIE root *bha- (2) "to speak" (cf. O.Ir. bann "law," Armenian ban "word;" see fame). Main modern sense of "to prohibit" (late 14c.) is from O.N. cognate banna "to curse, prohibit," and probably in part from O.Fr. ban, which meant "outlawry, banishment," among other things (see banal) and was a borrowing from Germanic. The sense evolution in Germanic was from "speak" to "proclaim a threat" to (in Norse, German, etc.) "curse." The Germanic root, borrowed in Latin and French, has been productive: cf. banish, bandit, contraband, etc. Related: Banned; banning. Banned in Boston dates from 1920s, in allusion to the excessive zeal and power of that city's Watch and Ward Society.

Gothic bandwa "a sign"). The extension to "group of musicians" is c.1660, originally musicians attached to a regiment of the army. To beat the band (1897) is to make enough noise to drown it out, hence to exceed everything.

Irish game, precursor of field hockey, played with curved a stick (also called a bandy), hence bandy-legged (1680s).
bane	beɪn	O.E. bana "killer, slayer, murderer; the devil," from P.Gmc. *banon, cognate with *banja- "wound" (cf. O.Fris. bona "murderer," O.N. bani, O.H.G. bana "murder," O.E. benn "wound," Goth. banja "stroke, wound"), from PIE root *gwhen- "to strike, kill, wound" (cf. Avestan banta "ill").

baneful	ˈbeɪnfəl	mid-13c., "recollection (of someone or something); awareness, consciousness," also "fame, renown, reputation," from Anglo-Fr. memorie (O.Fr. memoire, 11c., "mind, memory, remembrance; memorial, record") and directly from L. memoria "memory, remembrance, faculty of remembering," noun of quality from memor "mindful, remembering," from PIE root *(s)mer- "to remember" (Skt. smarati "remembers," Avestan mimara "mindful;" Gk. merimna "care, thought," mermeros "causing anxiety, mischievous, baneful;" Serbo-Croatian mariti "to care for;" Welsh marth "sadness, anxiety;" O.N. Mimir, name of the giant who guards the Well of Wisdom; O.E. gemimor "known," murnan "mourn, remember sorrowfully;" Du. mijmeren "to ponder"). Meaning "faculty of remembering" is late 14c. in English. I am grown old and my memory is not as active as it used to be. When I was younger I could remember anything, whether it had happened or not; but my faculties are decaying now and soon I shall be so I cannot remember any but the things that never happened.  It is sad to go to pieces like this, but we all have to do it. [Mark Twain, "Autobiography"] Computer sense, "device which stores information," is from 1946. Related: Memories.

bar	bɑ:	late 12c., "stake or rod of iron used to fasten a door or gate," from O.Fr. barre (12c.) "beam, bar, gate, barrier," from V.L. *barra "bar, barrier," which some suggest is from Gaulish *barros "the bushy end" [Gamillscheg], but OED regards this as "discredited" because it "in no way suits the sense."

Barley was not always the only crop grown as the data recovered at Bishopstone might suggest but it is always the most commonly represented, followed by wheat and then rye and oats. [C.J. Arnold, "An Archaeology of the Early Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms," 1988, p.36]  Another word for "barn" in O.E. was beretun, "barley enclosure" (from tun "enclosure, house"), which accounts for the many Barton place names on the English map, and the common surname.

"irregular," from Port. barroco "imperfect pearl," of uncertain origin, perhaps related to Sp. berruca "a wart."This style in decorations got the epithet of Barroque taste, derived from a word signifying pearls and teeth of unequal size. [Fuseli's translation of Winkelmann, 1765]Klein suggests the name may be from Italian painter Federigo Barocci (1528-1612), a founder of the style. How to tell baroque from rococo, according to Fowler: "The characteristics of baroque are grandeur, pomposity, and weight; those of rococo are inconsequence, grace, and lightness."

bather	ˈbeɪðə	 
bathetic	bəˈθetik	1834, from bathos on the model of pathetic, which, however, does not come directly from pathos (see pathetic), so the formation is either erroneous or humorous. Bathotic (1863, perhaps on model of chaotic) is not much better.

beach	bi:tʃ	1530s, "loose, water-worn pebbles of the seashore," probably from O.E. bæce, bece "stream," from P.Gmc. *bakiz.

The Greek and Roman Churches have long disputed about the beard. While the Romanists have at different times practised shaving, the Greeks, on the contrary, have sternuously defended the cause of long beards. Leo III. (795 AD) was the first shaved Pope. Pope Gregory IV., after the lapse of only 30 years, fulminated a Bull against bearded priests. In the 12th century the prescription of the beard was extended to the laity. Pope Honorius III. to disguise his disfigured lip, allowed his beard to grow. Henry I. of England was so much moved by a sermon directed against his beard that he resigned it to the barber. Frederick Barbarossa is said to have been equally tractable. [Tom Robinson, M.D., "Beards," "St. James's Magazine," 1881] 
bearing	ˈbɛəriŋ	"carrying of oneself, deportment," mid-13c., from bear (v.). Mechanical sense of "part of a machine that bears the friction" is from 1791.
beast	bi:st	c.1200, from O.Fr. beste "animal, wild beast," figuratively "fool, idiot" (11c., Mod.Fr. bête), from V.L. *besta, from L. bestia "beast, wild animal," of unknown origin. Used to translate Latin animal. Replaced O.E. deor (see deer) as the generic word for "wild creature," only to be ousted 16c. by animal. Of persons felt to be animal-like in various senses from early 13c. Of the figure in the Christian apocalypse story from late 14c.

beaver	ˈbi:və	O.E. beofor, befer (earlier bebr), from P.Gmc. *bebruz (cf. O.S. bibar, O.N. bjorr, M.Du., Du. bever, Low Ger. bever, O.H.G. bibar, Ger. Biber), from PIE *bhebhrus, reduplication of root *bher- (3) "brown, bright" (cf. Lith. bebrus, Czech bobr, Welsh befer; see bear (n.) for the likely reason for this). Gynecological sense ("female genitals, especially with a display of pubic hair") is 1927 British slang, transferred from earlier meaning "a bearded man" (1910), from the appearance of split beaver pelts.
beckon	ˈbekən	O.E. gebecnian (W. Saxon beacnian) "to make a mute sign," derivative of beacen "a sign, beacon," from P.Gmc. *bauknjan (cf. O.S. boknian, O.H.G. bouhnen), from PIE root *bha- "to shine" (see beacon). Related: Beckoned; beckoning. The noun is attested from 1718, from the verb.

bedizen	biˈdaizn	1660s, from be- + dizen "to dress" (1610s), especially, from late 18c., "to dress finely, adorn," originally "to dress (a distaff) for spinning" (1520s), and evidently the verbal form of the first element in distaff.  It is remarkable that neither the vb., nor the sb. as a separate word, has been found in OE. or ME., and that on the other hand no vb. corresponding to dizen is known in L.G. or Du. [OED] 
bedlam	ˈbedləm	"scene of mad confusion," 1660s, from colloquial pronunciation of "Hospital of Saint Mary of Bethlehem" in London, founded 1247 as a priory, mentioned as a hospital 1330 and as a lunatic hospital 1402; converted to a state lunatic asylum on dissolution of the monasteries in 1547.

Cognate O.E. compound behabban meant "to contain," and alternatively the modern sense of behave might have evolved from behabban via a notion of "self-restraint." Related: Behaved; behaving.
behavior	bɪˈheɪvjə	coined 1913 by U.S. psychologist John B. Watson (1878-1958) from behavior + -ism. Behaviorist is from the same time.
behemoth	biˈhi:mɔθ	late 14c., huge biblical beast (Job xl.15), from L. behemoth, from Heb. b'hemoth, usually taken as plural of intensity of b'hemah "beast." But the Hebrew word is perhaps a folk etymology of Egyptian pehemau, lit. "water-ox," the name for the hippopotamus.  Long before Jumbo was dreamed of, a hippo was exhibited by George K. Bailey, who invented the tank on wheels now used so generally in the circuses. The beast was advertised as "the blood sweating Behemoth of Holy Writ," and he made several men rich. [Isaac F. Marcosson, "Sawdust and Gold Dust," in "The Bookman," June 1910] 
behest	bɪˈhest	O.E. behæs "a vow," perhaps from behatan "to promise" (from be- + hatan "command, call;" see cite) and confused with obsolete hest "command," which may account for the parasitic -t as well as the M.E. shift in meaning to "command, injunction" (late 12c.).
behold	bɪˈhəʊld	"under obligation," mid-14c., originally pp. of behold (and preserving the original pp. of hold), but a sense directly related to this usage is not recorded among the many and varied meanings attested for behold.

belabor	bɪˈleɪbə	1590s, "to exert one's strength upon," from be- + labor (v.). But figurative sense of "assail with words" is attested somewhat earlier (1590s); and belabored is attested from mid-15c. with a sense of "tilled, cultivated."

belie	bɪˈlaɪ	O.E. beleogan "to deceive by lies," from be- + lie (v.1) "to lie, tell lies." Current sense of "to contradict as a lie" is first recorded 1640s. The other verb lie once also had a formation like this, from O.E. belicgan, which meant "to encompass, beleaguer," and in M.E. was a euphemism for "to have sex with" (i.e. "to lie with carnally").
believer	bɪˈli:və	"one who has faith in religion," 1540s, agent noun from believe.
belittle	bɪˈlɪtl	1781, "to make small," from be- + little (v.); first recorded in writings of Thomas Jefferson (and probably coined by him), who was roundly execrated for it in England:Belittle! What an expression! It may be an elegant one in Virginia, and even perfectly intelligible; but for our part, all we can do is to guess at its meaning. For shame, Mr. Jefferson! ["European Magazine and London Review," 1787, reporting on "Notes on the State of Virginia"; to guess was considered another barbarous Yankeeism.]Jefferson used it to characterize Buffon's view that American life was stunted by nature, which he was refuting.

Mitscherlich obtained it from a distillation of benzoic acid, obtained from benzoin. The form benzene dates from 1872 in English. In 19c. it also sometimes was called benzol. Faraday was first to discover the compound (in fish oil) and called it bicarburet of hydrogen.
bequeath	bɪˈkwi:ð	O.E. becweðan "to say, speak to, exhort, blame," also "leave by will;" from be- + cweðan "to say," from P.Gmc. *kwithan, from PIE *gwet- "to say, speak."

berserk	bə'sə:k	1844, from berserk (n.) "Norse warrior," by 1835, an alternative form of berserker (1822), a word which was introduced by Sir Walter Scott, from O.N. berserkr (n.) "raging warrior of superhuman strength;" probably from *ber- "bear" + serkr "shirt," thus lit. "a warrior clothed in bearskin." Thus not from O.N. berr "bare, naked."  Thorkelin, in the essay on the Berserkir, appended to his edition of the Krisini Saga, tells that an old name of the Berserk frenzy was hamremmi, i.e., strength acquired from another strange body, because it was anciently believed that the persons who were liable to this frenzy were mysteriously endowed, during its accesses, with a strange body of unearthly strength. If, however, the Berserk was called on by his own name, he lost his mysterious form, and his ordinary strength alone remained. ["Notes and Queries," Dec. 28, 1850]   The adjectival use probably is from such phrases as berserk frenzy, or as a title (Arngrim the Berserk).

O.S. bisprecan, Du. bespreken, O.H.G. bisprehhan, Ger. besprechen); originally "to call out," it evolved a wide range of meaning in English, including "speak up," "oppose," "request," "discuss, "arrange," and "to order (goods)" (1580s).  The connection of the senses is very loose; some of them appear to have arisen quite independently of each other from different applications of BE- pref. [OED] 
bespectacled	bɪˈspektəkəld	1742, pp. adj. from be- + spectacles.
best	best	O.E. beste, reduced by assimilation of -t- from earlier O.E. betst "best, first, in the best manner," originally superlative of bot "remedy, reparation," the root word now only surviving in to boot (see boot (2)), though its comparative, better, and superlative, best, have been transferred to good (and in some cases well). From P.Gmc. root *bat-, with comparative *batizon and superlative *batistaz (cf. O.Fris., O.S., M.Du. best, O.H.G. bezzist, Ger. best, O.N. beztr, Goth. batists).  The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men Gang aft agley, An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain, For promis'd joy! [Burns]  Best-seller as short for "best-selling book" is from 1902, apparently originally in the publishing trade; best friend was in Chaucer (late 14c.).

bestow	biˈstəu	1773, from bestow + -al (2).
bet	bet	1590s, as both a verb and noun, in the argot of petty criminals, of unknown origin; probably aphetic of abet or else from obsolete beet "to make good," from O.E. bætan "make better, arouse, stimulate," from P.Gmc. *baitjanan, in which case the verb would be the original. The original notion is perhaps "to improve" a contest by wagering on it, or it is from the "bait" sense in abet. Used since 1852 in various Amer.Eng. slang assertions (cf. you bet "be assured," 1857). Related: Betting.
betoken	bɪˈtəʊkən	late 12c., from be- + O.E. tacnian "to signify," from tacn "sign" (see token). Related: Betokened; betokening.

O.Fris. betera, O.S. betiro, O.N. betr, Dan. bedre, O.H.G. bezziro, Ger. besser, Goth. batiza). In English it superseded bet in the adverbial sense by 1600.

beverage	ˈbevəridʒ	mid-13c., from Anglo-Fr. beverage, O.Fr. bevrage, from O.Fr. boivre "to drink" (Mod.Fr. boire; from L. bibere "to imbibe;" see imbibe) + -age, suffix forming mass or abstract nouns.
bevy	ˈbevi:	early 15c., collective noun of quails and ladies, from Anglo-Fr. bevée, of unknown origin. One supposed definition of the word is "a drinking bout," but this is perhaps a misprint of bever, from O.Fr. beivre (see beverage). Still, it's possible that the original sense could be a company of birds gathered at a puddle or pool for drinking or bathing.
bewilder	biˈwildə	1680s, pp. adj. from bewilder (q.v.).
bewildering	biˈwildəriŋ	1783, "bewildering," from baffle; earlier a sailor's adjective for winds that blow variously and make headway difficult (c.1770s).

bicker	ˈbɪkə	c.1300, skirmish, battle; from the same source as bicker (v.). In modern use, often to describe the sound of a flight of an arrow or other repeated, loud, rapid sounds, in which sense it is perhaps at least partly echoic.
bid	bid	probably a merger of two old words: The sense in bid farewell is from O.E. biddan "to ask, entreat, pray, beseech; order; beg" (class V strong verb, past tense bæd, past participle beden), from P.Gmc. *bidjan "to pray, entreat" (cf. Ger. bitten "to ask," attested from 8c.), which, according to Kluge and Watkins is from a PIE root *gwhedh- "to ask, pray" (see bead (n.)).  To bid at an auction, meanwhile, is from O.E. beodan "offer, proclaim" (class II strong verb; p.t. bead, p.p. boden), from P.Gmc. *biudanan "to stretch out, reach out, offer, present," (cf. Ger. bieten "to offer"), from PIE root *bh(e)udh- "to be aware, make aware" (cf. Skt. bodhati "is awake, is watchful, observes," buddhah "awakened, enlightened;" O.C.S. bljudo "to observe;" Lith. budeti "to be awake;" O.Ir. buide "contentment, thanks"). As a noun, 1788, from the verb.
bidding	ˈbɪdɪŋ	"bidding, command, O.E. hæs "bidding, behest, command," from P.Gmc. *hait-ti-, from *haitan "to call, name" (see hight (v.)). With -t added in M.E. on model of other pairings (cf. wist/wesan).

Gk. peithein "to persuade," pistis "faith;" L. fidere "to trust," foedus "compact, treaty," O.C.S. beda "need"). Perhaps the sense evolved in prehistoric times through "endure," and "endure a wait," to "to wait." Preserved in Scotland and northern England, replaced elsewhere by abide in all senses except to bide one's time. Related: Bided; biding.
biennial	baɪˈeni:əl	"lasting for two years" (1620s); "occurring every two years" (1750), from L. biennium "two-year period," from bi- (see bi-) + annus "year" (see annual). The vowel change is "due to the Latin phonetic law according to which the unaccented and closed radical syllable of the second element of compounds, original -ă- becomes -ĕ-" [Klein]. The noun meaning "a biennial plant" is attested by 1770.
bifurcate	ˈbaɪfəˌkeɪt	1835, from M.L. bifurcatus, from L. bi- (see bi-) + furca, the root of fork.

bile	baɪl	1660s, from Fr. bile (17c.) "bile," also, informally, "anger," from L. bilis "fluid secreted by the liver," also one of the four humors (also known as choler), thus "anger, peevishness" (especially as black bile, 1797).

Meaning "wrathful, peevish, ill-tempered" (as people afflicted with an excess of bile were believed to be) is attested from 1560s. This is the main modern sense in English and French; the more literal meaning being taken up by biliary. Related: Biliousness.
bilk	bilk	1650s, from or along with the noun (1630s), first used as a cribbage term; as a verb, "to spoil (someone's) score." Origin obscure, it was believed in 17c. to be "a word signifying nothing;" perhaps it s a thinned form of balk "to hinder." Meaning "to defraud" is first recorded 1670s. Related: Bilked; bilking.

billowy	ˈbiləui	1610s, from billow (n.) + -y (2). Related: Billowiness.
bin	bin	"receptacle," O.E. binne "basket, manger, crib," probably from Gaulish, from O.Celt. *benna, akin to Welsh benn "a cart," especially one with a woven wicker body. The same Celtic word seems to be preserved in It. benna "dung cart," Fr. benne "grape-gatherer's creel," Du. benne "large basket," all from L.L. benna "cart," M.L. benna "basket." Some linguists think there was a Germanic form parallel to the Celtic one.
binary	ˈbaɪnəri:	"dual," mid-15c., from L.L. binarius "consisting of two," from bini "twofold, two apiece, two-by-two" (used especially of matched things), from bis "double" (see bis-). Binary code in computer terminology was in use by 1952, though the idea itself is ancient. Binary star in astronomy is from 1802.

biography	baiˈɔɡrəfi	1680s, probably from L. biographia, from Late Gk. biographia "description of life," from Gk. bio- "life" (see bio-) + graphia "record, account" (see -graphy). Biographia was not in classical Greek (bios alone was the word for it), though it is attested in later Greek from c.500.

Birke), from PIE *bhergo (cf. Ossetian barz, O.C.S. breza, Rus. bereza, Lith. berŽas, Skt. bhurjah, L. farnus, fraxinus "mountain ash"), from root *bhereg- "to gleam, white." Meaning "bunch of birch twigs used for flogging" (1640s) led to verb meaning "to flog" (1830). Related: Birched; birching. Birch beer is by 1827, Amer.Eng.
bird	bə:d	O.E. bird, rare collateral form of bridd, originally "young bird, nestling" (the usual O.E. for "bird" being fugol), of uncertain origin with no cognates in any other Germanic language. The suggestion that it is related by umlaut to brood and breed is rejected by OED as "quite inadmissible." Metathesis of -r- and -i- was complete 15c.  Middle English, in which bird referred to various young animals and even human beings, may have preserved the original meaning of this word. Despite its early attestation, bridd is not necessarily the oldest form of bird. It is usually assumed that -ir- from -ri- arose by metathesis, but here, too, the Middle English form may go back to an ancient period. [Liberman]  Figurative sense of "secret source of information" is from 1540s. Bird dog (n.) attested from 1832, a gun dog used in hunting game birds; hence the verb (1941) meaning "to follow closely." Bird-watching attested from 1897. Bird's-eye view is from 1762. For the birds recorded from 1944, supposedly in allusion to birds eating from droppings of horses and cattle.A byrde yn honde ys better than three yn the wode. [c.1530]

bit	bit	"small piece," c.1200, from related O.E. words bite "act of biting," and bita "piece bitten off," are probably the source of the modern words meaning "boring-piece of a drill" (1590s), "mouthpiece of a horse's bridle" (mid-14c.), and "a piece bitten off, morsel" (c.1000). All from P.Gmc. *biton (cf. O.S. biti, O.N. bit, O.Fris. bite, M.Du. bete, O.H.G. bizzo "biting," Ger. Bissen "a bite, morsel"), from PIE root *bheid- "to split" (see fissure). Meaning "small piece, fragment" is from c.1600. Sense of "short space of time" is 1650s. Theatrical bit part is from 1909. Money sense in two bits, six bits, etc. is originally from Southern U.S. and West Indies, in reference to silver wedges cut or stamped from Spanish dollars (later Mexican reals); transferred to "eighth of a dollar."
bite	bait	O.E. bitan (class I strong verb; past tense bat, pp. biten), from P.Gmc. *bitan (cf. O.S. bitan, O.N., O.Fris. bita, M.Du. biten, Du. bijten, Ger. beissen, Goth. beitan "to bite"), from PIE root *bheid- "to split, crack" (see fissure).  To bite the bullet is said to be 1700s military slang, from old medical custom of having the patient bite a lead bullet during an operation to divert attention from pain and reduce screaming. Figurative use from 1891; the custom itself attested from 1840s. To bite (one's) tongue "refrain from speaking" is 1590s. To bite the dust "die" is 1750 (Latin had the same image; cf. Virgil: procubuit moriens et humum semel ore momordit). To bite off more than one can chew (c.1880) is U.S. slang, from plug tobacco.
biting	ˈbaɪtɪŋ	"small piece," c.1200, from related O.E. words bite "act of biting," and bita "piece bitten off," are probably the source of the modern words meaning "boring-piece of a drill" (1590s), "mouthpiece of a horse's bridle" (mid-14c.), and "a piece bitten off, morsel" (c.1000). All from P.Gmc. *biton (cf. O.S. biti, O.N. bit, O.Fris. bite, M.Du. bete, O.H.G. bizzo "biting," Ger. Bissen "a bite, morsel"), from PIE root *bheid- "to split" (see fissure). Meaning "small piece, fragment" is from c.1600. Sense of "short space of time" is 1650s. Theatrical bit part is from 1909. Money sense in two bits, six bits, etc. is originally from Southern U.S. and West Indies, in reference to silver wedges cut or stamped from Spanish dollars (later Mexican reals); transferred to "eighth of a dollar."
bitter	ˈbitə	In lexicons of sea language going back to 1759, the bitter end is the part of a cable which is round about the bits (two great timbers used to belay cables) when the ship is at anchor.  Bitter end of the Cable, the End which is wound about the Bitts. ["The News-Readers Pocket-Book: Or, a Military Dictionary," London, 1759]  See Bit. So, when a cable is played out to the bitter end, there is no more left to play. The term began to be used c.1835 in non-nautical use and with probable influence of bitter (adj.).
bitumen	bɪˈtu:mən	mid-15c., from L. bitumen "asphalt," probably, via Oscan or Umbrian, from  Celtic *betu- "birch, birch resin" (cf. Gaulish betulla "birch," used by Pliny for the tree supposedly the source of bitumen).
bizarre	biˈzɑ:	1640s, from Fr. bizarre "odd, fantastic" (16c.), originally "handsome, brave," perhaps from Basque bizar "a beard" (the notion being of bearded Spanish soldiers making a strange impression on the French); alternative etymology traces it to It. bizarro "angry, fierce, irascible," from bizza "fit of anger."
blab	blæb	mid-15c., apparently from M.E. noun blabbe "one who does not control his tongue" (late 13c.), probably echoic. Related: Blabbed; blabbing. The exact relationship between the blabs and blabber is difficult to determine. The noun was "[e]xceedingly common in 16th and 17th c.; unusual in literature since c 1750" [OED]. 

blackball	ˈblækbɔ:l	also black-ball, "to exclude from a club by adverse votes," 1770, from black (adj.) + ball (1). Black balls of wood or ivory dropped into an urn during secret ballots.

Verbal phrase black out, in reference to printed or written matter deemed objectionable and covered in black ink, is attested from 1888.
blade	bleid	O.E. blæd "a leaf," but also "a leaf-like part" (of spade, oar, etc.), from P.Gmc. *bladaz (cf. O.Fris. bled "leaf," Ger. blatt, O.S., Dan., Du. blad, O.N. blað), from PIE *bhle-to-, suffixed form (p.p.) of *bhel- (3) "to thrive, bloom," possibly identical with *bhel- (2) "to blow, swell" (see bole). Extended in M.E. to shoulders (c.1300) and swords (early 14c.). The modern use in reference to grass may be a M.E. revival, by influence of O.Fr. bled "corn, wheat" (11c., perhaps from Germanic). The cognate in German, Blatt, is the general word for "leaf;" Laub is used collectively as "foliage." O.N. blað was used of herbs and plants, lauf in reference to trees. This might have been the original distinction in Old English, too. Of men from 1590s; in later use often a reference to 18c. gallants, but the original exact sense, and thus signification, is uncertain.
blame	bleim	early 13c., from O.Fr. blasme "blame, reproach; condemnation," a back formation from blasmer (see blame (v.)).
blanch	blæntʃ	"to start back, turn aside," 1570s, variant of blench. Related: Blanched; blanching.
bland	blænd	1660s, from It. blando "delicate," or O.Fr. bland "flattering, complimentary," both from L. blandus "smooth-talking, flattering, alluring," perhaps from PIE *mlad-, nasalized variant of *meld-, extended form of root *mel- (see melt). Related: Blandly; blandness. Latin also had blandiloquentulus "flattering in speech," which might have yielded a useful English *blandiloquent.
blandish	ˈblændɪʃ	"flattering speech," 1590s, from blandish + -ment. Sense of "attraction, allurement" (often blandishments) is from 1590s.

blare	bleə	late 14c., bleren "to wail," possibly from an unrecorded O.E. *blæren, or from M.Du. bleren "to bleat, cry, bawl, shout." Probably echoic, either way. Related: Blared; blaring. As a noun from 1809, from the verb.

Second element is pheme "utterance" (see fame); first element uncertain, perhaps related to blaptikos "hurtful," though blax "slack (in body and mind), stupid" also has been suggested.
blast	blɑ:st	O.E. blæst "blowing, breeze, puff of wind," from P.Gmc. *bles- (cf. O.N. blastr, O.H.G. blast "a blowing, blast," Ger. blasen, Goth. blesan "to blow"), from PIE *bhle- "to blow," probably a variant of root *bhel- (2) "to blow, inflate, swell" (see bole).

bleach	bli:tʃ	O.E. blæcan "bleach, whiten," from P.Gmc. *blaikjan "to make white" (cf. O.S. blek, O.N. bleikr, Du. bleek, O.H.G. bleih, Ger. bleich "pale;" O.N. bleikja, Du. bleken, Ger. bleichen "to bleach"), from PIE root *bhel- (1) "to shine, flash, burn" (cf.

OED says it probably is "more or less onomatopœic," and adds "there is nothing to indicate a French origin." Before that it typically meant "violent blow," also "hail of gunfire" in American English from 1829, and blizz "violent rainstorm" is attested from 1770.

blonde	blɔnd	late 15c.; see blond (adj.).
bloom	blu:m	"rough mass of wrought iron," from O.E. bloma "lump of metal; mass," of unknown origin. Identical in form to bloom (n.1), and sometimes regarded as a secondary sense of it, but evidence of a connection is wanting.

blossom	ˈblɔsəm	late 14c., from O.E. blostmian, from blostma "blossom, flower" (see blossom (n.)). Figurative use from late 14c. Related: Blossomed; blossoming.

blotto	ˈblɔtəʊ	"drunk," c.1905, from some signification of blot (v.) in its "soak up liquid" meaning.
blowhard	ˈbləʊˌhɑ:d	also blow-hard, 1840, a sailor's word (from 1790 as a nickname for a sailor), perhaps not originally primarily meaning "braggart;" from blow (v.1) + hard (adv.). An adjective sense of "boastful" appeared c.1855, and may be a separate formation leading to a modified noun use.
bludgeon	ˈblʌdʒən	1802, from earlier noun bludgeon "short club" (1730), of unknown origin. Related: Bludgeoned; bludgeoning. 
blue	blu:	"to make blue," c.1600, from blue (1).

bluff	blʌf	"broad, vertical cliff," 1680s, from bluff (adj.) "with a broad, flat front" (1620s), a sailors' word, probably from Du. blaf "flat, broad." Apparently a North Sea nautical term for ships with flat vertical bows, later extended to landscape features.

blunt	blʌnt	street slang for "marijuana and tobacco cigar" (easier to pass around, easier to disguise, and the stimulant in the tobacco enhances the high from the pot) surfaced c.1993, but is said to have originated among Jamaicans in New York City in the early 1980s; from Phillies Blunt brand cigars; see blunt (adj.), which has been used of certain cigars since 19c.Users say that the Phillies Blunt brand produces less harsh-tasting or sweeter smoke. The leaf wrapper of a Phillies Blunt is strong enough to hold together through the manipulations of making a blunt. Other brands fall apart. [http://nepenthes.lycaeum.org/Drugs/THC/Smoke/blunts.html]
blur	blə:	1580s, and thus probably from blur (n.), but the dates are close and either might be the original. Related: Blurred; blurring.
blurb	blə:b	used by U.S. scholar Brander Matthews (1852-1929) in 1906 in "American Character;" popularized 1907 by U.S. humorist Frank Gelett Burgess (1866-1951). Originally mocking excessive praise printed on book jackets.  Gelett Burgess, whose recent little book, "Are You a Bromide?" has been referred to above, then entertained the guests with some characteristic flashes of Burgessian humor. Referring to the word "blurb" on the wrapper of his book he said: "To 'blurb' is to make a sound like a publisher. The blurb was invented by Frank A. Munsey when he wrote on the front of his magazine in red ink 'I consider this number of Munsey's the hottest pie that ever came out of my bakery.' ... A blurb is a check drawn on Fame, and it is seldom honored.["] ["Publishers' Weekly," May 18, 1907] 
blurry	ˈblɜ:rɪ	1855, from blur + -y (2). Related: Blurrily; blurriness.
blurt	blə:t	1570s, probably echoic. Related: blurted; blurting. As a noun, 1570s, probably from the verb.
blush	blʌʃ	mid-14c., "a look, a glance" (sense preserved in at first blush), also "a gleam, a gleaming" (late 14c.), from blush (v.). As "a reddening of the face" from 1590s. Meaning "a rosy color" is 1590s.
bluster	ˈblʌstə	1580s, from bluster (v.).
blustering	ˈblʌstəriŋ	1707, from bluster (n.) + -y (2). Blustering in this sense is recorded from 1510s.
board	bɔ:d	O.E. bord "a plank, flat surface," from P.Gmc. *burdam (cf. O.N. borð "plank," Du. bord "board," Goth. fotu-baurd "foot-stool," Ger. Brett "plank"), from PIE *bhrdh- "board," from root *bherdh- "to cut." See also board (n.2), with which this is so confused as practically to form one word (if indeed they were not the same word all along). A board is thinner than a plank, and generally less than 2.5 inches thick. The transferred meaning "food" (late 14c.) is an extension of the late O.E. sense of "table" (cf. boarder, boarding); hence, also, above board "honest, open" (1610s). A further extension is to "table where council is held" (1570s), then transferred to "leadership council, council (that meets at a table)," 1610s.


boast	bəust	early 14c., "to brag, speak arrogantly;" from the same source as boast (n.). Related: Boasted; boasting.
boastful	ˈbəʊstfʊl	early 14c., from boast (n.) + -ful. Related: Boastfully; boastfulness.
bob	ˈbɔb	"move with a short, jerking motion," late 14c., probably connected to M.E. bobben "to strike, beat" (late 13c.), perhaps of echoic origin. Another early sense was "to make a fool of, cheat" (early 14c.). Related: Bobbed; bobbing. The sense in bobbing for apples (or cherries) recorded by 1799.
bode	bəʊd	O.E. bodian "proclaim, announce; foretell," from boda "messenger," probably from P.Gmc. *budon- (cf. O.S. gibod, Ger. gebot, O.N. boð), from PIE *bheudh- "be aware, make aware" (cf. bid). As a shortened form of forebode (usually evil), it dates from 1740. Related: Boded; boding.
boding	ˈbəudiŋ	1560s, from L. dirus "fearful, awful, boding ill," of unknown origin; perhaps from Oscan and Umbrian and perhaps cognate with Gk. deinos, from PIE root *dwei-.
bodyguard	ˈbɔdi:ˌgɑ:d	1735, "retinue, escort," collective singular, from body + guard. Attested 1861 as "a soldier of the bodyguard."
bog	bɔɡ	c.1500, from Gaelic and Irish bogach "bog," from adj. bog "soft, moist," from PIE *bhugh-, from root *bheugh- "to bend" (see bow (v.)). Bog-trotter applied to the wild Irish from 1670s.
boggle	ˈbɔgəl	1590s, "to start with fright" (as a startled horse does), from M.E. bugge "specter" (among other things, supposed to scare horses at night); see bug; also cf. bogey (1). The meaning "to raise scruples, hesitate" is from 1630s. Related: Boggled; boggling.
bogus	ˈbəʊgəs	1838, "counterfeit money, spurious coin," Amer.Eng., apparently from a slang word applied (according to some sources first in Ohio in 1827) to a counterfeiter's apparatus.  One bogus or machine impressing dies on the coin, with a number of dies, engraving tools, bank bill paper, spurious coin, &c. &c. making in all a large wagon load, was taken into possession by the attorney general of Lower Canada. [Niles' Register, Sept. 7, 1833, quoting from Concord, N.H., "Statesman," Aug. 24]   Some trace this to tantrabobus, also tantrabogus, a late 18c. colloquial Vermont word for any odd-looking object, in later 19c. use "the devil," which might be connected to tantarabobs, recorded as a Devonshire name for the devil. Others trace it to the same source as bogey (1).
bohemian	bəuˈhi:mjən	"a gypsy of society," 1848, from Fr. bohemién (1550s), from the country name (see Bohemia). The modern sense is perhaps from the use of this country name since 15c. in French for "gypsy" (they were wrongly believed to have come from there, though their first appearance in W.Europe may have been directly from there), or from association with 15c. Bohemian heretics. It was popularized by Henri Murger's 1845 story collection "Scenes de la Vie de Boheme," the basis of Puccini's "La Bohème." Used in English 1848 in Thackary's "Vanity Fair."The term 'Bohemian' has come to be very commonly accepted in our day as the description of a certain kind of literary gipsey, no matter in what language he speaks, or what city he inhabits .... A Bohemian is simply an artist or littérateur who, consciously or unconsciously, secedes from conventionality in life and in art. ["Westminster Review," 1862]
boil	bɔil	early 13c., from O.Fr. bolir "boil, bubble up, ferment, gush" (12c., Mod.Fr. bouillir), from L. bullire "to bubble, seethe," from bulla "a bubble, knob" (see bull (2)). The native word is seethe. Figurative sense of "to agitate the feelings" is from 1640s.I am impatient, and my blood boyls high. [Thomas Otway, "Alcibiades," 1675] Related: Boiled; boiling. Boiling point is recorded from 1773.
boisterous	ˈbɔɪstərəs	late 15c., unexplained alteration of M.E. boistous (c.1300) "rough, coarse (as of food), clumsy, violent," of unknown origin, perhaps from Anglo-Fr. bustous "rough (road)," which is perhaps from O.Fr. boisteos "curved, lame; uneven, rough" (Mod.Fr. boiteux), itself of obscure origin. Another guess traces it via Celtic to L. bestia. Used of persons from 1560s. Related: Boisterously; boisterousness.
bold	bəuld	O.E. beald (W.Saxon), bald (Anglian) "bold, brave, confident, strong," from P.Gmc. *balthaz (cf. O.H.G. bald "bold, swift," in names such as Archibald, Leopold, Theobald; Goth. balþei "boldness;" O.N. ballr "frightful, dangerous"), perhaps from PIE *bhol-to- suffixed form of *bhel- (2) "to blow, swell" (see bole). Old French and Provençal baut "bold," Italian baldo "bold, daring, fearless" are Germanic loan-words.
bolster	ˈbəʊlstə	mid-15c. (implied in bolstered), "propped up, made to bulge" (originally of a woman's breasts), from bolster (n.). Figurative sense is from c.1500, on the notion of "to support with a bolster, prop up." Related: Bolstering.
bolt	bəult	O.E. bolt "short, stout arrow with a heavy head;" also "crossbow for throwing bolts," from P.Gmc. *bultas (cf. O.N. bolti, Dan. bolt, Du. bout, Ger. Bolzen), perhaps from PIE root *bheld- "to knock, strike" (cf. Lith. beldu "I knock," baldas "pole for striking"). Applied since M.E. to other short metal rods (especially those with knobbed ends). From the notion of an arrow's flight comes the lightning bolt (1530s). A bolt of canvas (c.1400) was so called for its shape. Adverbial phrase bolt upright is from late 14c.
bolted	 	"enclosure for animals," O.E. penn, penne, "enclosure," perhaps related to O.E. pinn "pin, peg" (see pin) on notion of a bolted gate or else "structure made of pointed stakes." The verb, "to enclose in a pen" is attested from c.1200. Slang noun meaning "prison" (1884) is shortening of penitentiary (q.v.), but earlier use (1845) is probably a fig. extension of this word.
bombardment	bɔmˈbɑ:dmənt	attested by 1824. Phrase everything but (or 'and') the kitchen sink is 1944, from World War II armed forces slang, in reference to intense bombardment.  Out for blood, our Navy throws everything but the kitchen sink at Jap vessels, warships and transports alike. [Shell fuel advertisement, "Life," Jan. 24, 1944]  
bombast	ˈbɔmˌbæst	1704, "inflated," from bombast + -ic. Meaning "given to bombastic language" is from 1727.

bond	bɔnd	"one who stands surety by bond," 1754, from bond (n.) + man (n.), with gen. -s- added probably in part to avoid confusion with bondman.
bondage	ˈbɔndidʒ	c.1300, "condition of a serf or slave," from Anglo-L. bondagium, from M.E. bond "a serf, tenant farmer," from O.E. bonda "householder," from O.N. boandi "free-born farmer," noun use of prp. of boa "dwell, prepare, inhabit," from PIE *bhow-, from root *bheue- "to be, exist, dwell" (see be). Meaning in English changed by influence of bond. The sexual sado-masochism sense is recorded by 1966.
bonhomie	ˌbɔnɔˈmi:	"good nature," 1803, French, from bonhomme "good man" (with unusual loss of -m-), from bon "good" (see bon) + homme "man," from L. homo (see homunculus).
bonnet	ˈbɔnɪt	late 14c., Scottish bonat "brimless hat for men," from O.Fr. bonet, short for chapel de bonet, from bonet (12c., Mod.Fr. bonnet) "kind of cloth used as a headdress," from M.L. bonitum "material for hats," perhaps aphetic of L.L. abonnis "a kind of cap" (7c.), which is perhaps from a Germanic source. 
bonny	ˈbɔni:	1540s, of unknown origin, apparently from O.Fr. bon, bone "good" (see bon).
bonus	ˈbəunəs	1773, "Stock Exchange Latin" [Weekley], from L. bonus "good" (adj.); see bene-. The correct noun form would be bonum. In U.S. history the bonus army was tens of thousands of World War I veterans and followers who marched on Washington, D.C., in 1932 demanding early redemption of their service bonus certificates (which carried a maximum value of $625).
boo	bu:	"to startle," early 15c., boh, "A combination of consonant and vowel especially fitted to produce a loud and startling sound" [OED, which compares L. boare, Gk. boaein "to cry aloud, roar, shout."]; as an expression of disapproval, 1801 (n.), 1816 (v.); hence, the verb meaning "shower someone with boos" (1893). Booing was common late 19c. among London theater audiences and at British political events; In Italy, Parma opera-goers were notorious boo-birds, but the custom seems to have been little-known in America till c.1910. To say boo "open one's mouth, speak," originally was to say boo to a goose.
book	buk	O.E. boc "book, writing, written document," traditionally from P.Gmc. *bokiz "beech" (cf. Ger. Buch "book" Buche "beech;" see beech), the notion being of beechwood tablets on which runes were inscribed, but it may be from the tree itself (people still carve initials in them). The O.E. originally meant any written document. Latin and Sanskrit also have words for "writing" that are based on tree names ("birch" and "ash," respectively). Meaning "libretto of an opera" is from 1768. A betting book is from 1856.
bookcase	ˈbʊkˌkeɪs	1726, from book + case (2). An O.E. word for this was bocfodder.

bookkeeping	ˈbʊkˌki:pɪŋ	1868, "right to the present time," from phrase up to date, probably originally from bookkeeping. Meaning "having the latest facts" is recorded from 1889; that of "having current styles and tastes" is from 1891.
bookstall	ˈbʊkˌstɔ:l	 
boom	bu:m	"long pole," 1540s, from Scottish boun, borrowed from Du. boom "tree, pole, beam," from a M.Du. word analogous to O.E. beam (see beam). The business sense (1873) is sometimes said to be from this word, from the nautical meaning "a long spar run out to extend the foot of a sail;" a ship "booming" being one in full sail. But it could just as well be from boom (v.), on the notion of "suddenness."
boon	bu:n	in boon companion (1560s), only real survival of M.E. boon "good" (early 14c.), from O.Fr. bon (see bon).
boor	bʊə	1560s, from boor (n.) + -ish. Related: Boorishly; boorishness.

booster	ˈbu:stə	1890, "one who boosts" something, agent noun from boost (v.). Electrical sense is recorded from 1894. Young child's booster chair is attested under that name from 1960.
booth	bu:ð	mid-12c., from O.Dan. boþ "temporary dwelling," from E.Norse *boa "to dwell," from P.Gmc. *bowan-, from PIE root *bheue- "to be, exist, grow" (see be). See also bound (adj.2). Cf. Ger. Bude "booth, stall," M.Du. boode, Lith. butas "house," O.Ir both "hut," Boh. bouda, Pol. buda, some probably borrowed from E.Norse, some formed from the PIE root.
bootless	ˈbu:tlis	late O.E. botleas "unpardonable, not to be atoned for, without help or remedy," from boot (n.2) + -less. Meaning "useless, unprofitable" is from early 15c.
booze	bu:z	by 1768, "to drink a lot" (v.), variant of M.E. bouse (c.1300), from M.Du. busen "to drink heavily," related to M.H.G. bus (intrans.) "to swell, inflate," of unknown origin. The noun is recorded by 1821, perhaps 1714; reinforced by name of Philadelphia distiller E.G. Booze. Boozy (1719) was one of Benjamin Franklin's 225 synonyms for "drunk," published in 1722. In New Zealand from c.WWII, a drinking binge was a boozeroo.

boredom	ˈbɔ:dəm	"state of being bored," 1852, from bore (v.1) + -dom. It also has been employed in a sense "bores as a class" (1883) and "practice of being a bore" (1864, a sense properly belonging to boreism, 1833).
borehole	ˈbɔ:həul	 
boring	ˈbɔ:riŋ	mid-15c., "action of piercing," from bore (v.). From 1853 in reference to animals that bore; 1840 in the sense "wearying, causing ennui."
borough	ˈbʌrə	O.E. burg, burh "a dwelling or dwellings within a fortified enclosure," from P.Gmc. *burgs "hill fort, fortress" (cf. O.Fris. burg "castle," O.N. borg "wall, castle," O.H.G. burg, buruc "fortified place, citadel," Ger. Burg "castle," Goth. baurgs "city"), from PIE *bhrgh "high," with derivatives referring to hills, hill forts, fortified elevations (cf. O.E. beorg "hill," Welsh bera "stack, pyramid," Skt. bhrant-, Avestan brzant- "high," Gk. Pergamos, name of the citadel of Troy).  In German and Old Norse, chiefly as "fortress, castle;" in Gothic, "town, civic community." Meaning shifted M.E. from "fortress," to "fortified town," to simply "town" (especially one possessing municipal organization or sending representatives to Parliament). In U.S. (originally Pennsylvania, 1718) often an incorporated town; in Alaska, however, it is the equivalent of a county. The Scottish form is burgh. The O.E. dative singular byrig is found in many place names as -bury.
bosom	ˈbuzəm	O.E. bosm "breast; womb; surface; ship's hold," from W.Gmc. *bosm- (cf. O.Fris. bosm, O.S. bosom, M.Du. boesem, Du. boezem, O.H.G. buosam, Ger. Busen "bosom, breast"), perhaps from PIE root *bhou- "to grow, swell," or *bhaghus "arm" (in which case the primary notion would be "enclosure formed by the breast and the arms"). Narrowed meaning "a woman's breasts" is from 1959; but bosomy "big-breasted" is from 1928. Bosom-friend is attested 1580s; bosom buddy from 1920s.
bossy	ˈbɔ:si:	1540s, "swelling, projecting and rounded, decorated with bosses" from boss (2). Meaning "domineering, fond of ordering people about" is recorded 1882, from boss (1). As a common cow name it represents L. bos "cow."

boudoir	ˈbu:ˌdwɑ:	1777, "room where a lady may retire to be alone," from Fr. boudoir (18c.), lit. "pouting room," from bouder "to pout, sulk," which, like pout, probably ultimately is imitative of puffing.
bough	baʊ	O.E. bog "shoulder, arm," extended O.E. to "twig, branch" (cf. limb), from P.Gmc. *bogaz (cf. O.N. bogr "shoulder," O.H.G. buog, Ger. Bug "shoulder, hock, joint"), from PIE *bhagus "elbow, forearm" (cf. Skt. bahus "arm," Armenian bazuk, Gk. pakhys "forearm"). The "limb of a tree" sense is peculiar to English.
bouillon	ˈbu:jɔŋ	1650s, from Fr. bouillon (11c.), noun use of pp. of bouillir "to boil," from O.Fr. bolir (see boil (v.)).
boulder	ˈbəʊldə	1670s, variant of M.E. bulder (c.1300), from a Scandinavian source akin to Swed. dial. bullersten "noisy stone" (large stone in a stream, causing water to roar around it), from bullra "to roar" + sten "stone." Or the first element may be from *buller- "round object," from P.Gmc. *bul-, from PIE *bhel- (2) "to inflate, swell" (see bole).

bound	baund	1560s, "one who sets bounds," from bound (n.); British English slang meaning "person of objectionable social behavior, would-be stylish person," is from 1882, perhaps from bound (v.) on notion of one trying to "bound" into high society, but earliest usage suggests one outside the "bounds" of acceptable socializing, which would connect it with the noun.

bourgeois	ˈbuəʒwɑ:	1560s, "of the French middle class," from Fr. bourgeois, from O.Fr. burgeis, borjois "town dweller" (see bourgeoisie). Sense of "socially or aesthetically conventional" is from 1764; in communist and socialist writing, as a noun, "a capitalist" (1883).It is better to be a good ordinary bourgeois than a bad ordinary bohemian. [Aldous Huxley, 1930]
bout	baut	1540s, from M.E. bught, probably from an unrecorded O.E. variant of byht "a bend," from P.Gmc. *bukhta-. Sense evolved from "a circuit of any kind" (as of a plow) to "a round at any kind of exercise" (1570s), "a round at fighting" (1590s), "a fit of drinking" (1660s).
boutique	bu:ˈti:k	"fashion shop," 1953, earlier "small shop of any sort" (1767), from Fr. boutique (14c.), from O.Prov. botica, from Gk. apotheke (see apothecary).
bovine	ˈbəʊˌvaɪn	1817, from Fr. bovin (14c.), from L.L. bovinus, from L. bos (gen. bovis) "ox, cow," from PIE *gwous- (see cow). Figurative sense of "inert and stupid" is from 1855.
bow	bəu	O.E. bugan "to bend, to bow down, to bend the body in condescension," also "to turn back" (class II strong verb; past tense beag, pp. bogen), from P.Gmc. *bugon (cf. Du. buigen, M.L.G. bugen, O.H.G. biogan, Ger. biegen, Goth. biugan "to bend," O.N. boginn "bent"), from *beugen, from PIE root *bheug- (3) "to bend," with derivatives referring to bent, pliable, or curved objects (cf. Skt. bhujati "bends, thrusts aside;" O.H.G. boug, O.E. beag "a ring"). The noun is first recorded 1650s. Bow out "withdraw" is from 1942.   
bowdlerize	ˈbaudləraiz	1836, from Thomas Bowdler (1754-1825), English editor who in 1818 published a notorious expurgated Shakespeare, in which, according to his frontispiece, "nothing is added to the original text; but those words and expressions omitted which cannot with propriety be read aloud in a family." Related: Bowdlerized; bowdlerizing.
bowel	ˈbauəl	c.1300, from O.Fr. boele "intestines, bowels, innards" (12c., Mod.Fr. boyau), from M.L. botellus "small intestine," originally "sausage," dim. of botulus "sausage," a word borrowed from Oscan-Umbrian, from PIE *gwet-/*geut- "intestine" (cf. L. guttur "throat," O.E. cwið, Goth. qiþus "belly, womb," Ger. kutteln "guts, chitterlings"). Greek splankhnon (from the same PIE root as spleen) was a word for the principal internal organs, which also were felt in ancient times to be the seat of various emotions. Greek poets, from Aeschylus down, regarded the bowels as the seat of the more violent passions such as anger and love, but by the Hebrews they were seen as the seat of tender affections, especially kindness, benevolence, and compassion. Splankhnon was used in Septuagint to translate a Hebrew word, and from thence early Bibles in English rendered it in its literal sense as bowels, which thus acquired in English a secondary meaning of "pity, compassion" (late 14c.). But in later editions the word often was translated as heart. Bowel movement is attested by 1874. 
bower	ˈbaʊə	O.E. bur "room, hut, dwelling, chamber," from P.Gmc. *buraz (cf. O.N. bur "chamber," Swed. bur "cage," O.H.G. bur "dwelling, chamber," Ger. Bauer "birdcage"), from *bu- "to dwell," from PIE root *bheue- "to be, exist, dwell" (see be). Modern spelling developed after mid-14c. Sense of "leafy arbor" (place closed in by trees) is first attested 1520s. Hence, too, Australia's bower-bird (1847).
boycott	ˈbɔikɔt	1880, noun and verb, from Irish Land League ostracism of Capt. Charles C. Boycott (1832-1897), land agent of Lough-Mask in County Mayo, who refused to lower rents for his tenant farmers. Quickly adopted by newspapers in languages as far afield as Japanese (boikotto). The family name is from a place in England.
brace	breis	mid-14c., "to seize, grasp," also "wrap, enshroud; tie up, fetter," from O.Fr. bracier, from brace (see brace (n.)). Meaning "to render firm or steady by tensing" is mid-15c., earlier in figurative sense "strengthen or comfort" (someone), early 15c., with later extension to tonics, etc. that "brace" the nerves (cf. bracer "stiff drink"). Related: Braced; bracing.
bracelet	ˈbreislit	mid-15c., from O.Fr. bracelet (14c.), dim. of bracel, from L. bracchiale "armlet," from bracchium (see brace (n.)).

Related: Braced; bracing.
bracket	ˈbrækit	1570s, bragget, probably from M.Fr. braguette "codpiece armor" (16c.), from a fancied resemblance of that article to architectural supports (Spanish cognate bragueta meant both "codpiece" and "bracket"), dim. of brague "knee pants," ultimately from Gaulish *braca "pants," itself perhaps from Germanic (cf. O.E. broc "garment for the legs and trunk;" see breeches). The sense might reflect the "breeches" sense, on the notion of two limbs or of appliances used in pairs. The typographical bracket is first recorded 1750, so called for its resemblance to double supports in carpentry. Senses affected by L. brachium "arm."
brackish	ˈbrækiʃ	1530s, from Scottish brack "salty" (see brack) + -ish.
brag	bræɡ	late 14c., "pomp; arrogance, pride;" see brag (v.); the exact relationship of the forms is uncertain. Meaning "that which is boasted" is from 1530s. As a once-popular poker-like card game, from 1734.
braggadocio	bræɡəˈdəuʃiəu	Spenser's coinage, 1590, as a name for his personification of vainglory, from brag, with augmentative ending by analogy to the Italian words then in vogue in England. In general use by 1594 for "an empty swaggerer;" of the talk of such persons, from 1734.
braggart	ˈbræɡət	1570s, from Fr. bragard (16c.), with pejorative ending (see -ard) + M.Fr. braguer "to flaunt, brag," perhaps originally "to show off clothes, especially breeches," from brague "breeches" (see bracket). There may be an element of codpiece-flaunting in all this. The word in English at least has been influenced by brag (v.), even if, as some claim, it is unrelated to it. Bragger "arrogant or boastful person," agent noun from brag (v.), attested in English from late 14c.
braid	breɪd	in part from stem found in O.E. gebrægd "craft, fraud," gebregd "commotion," O.N. bragð "deed, trick," and in part from or influenced by related braid (v.).

brain	brein	O.E. brægen "brain," from P.Gmc. *bragnam (cf. M.L.G. bregen, O.Fris., Du. brein), from PIE root *mregh-m(n)o- "skull, brain" (cf. Gk. brekhmos "front part of the skull, top of the head"). But Liberman writes that brain "has no established cognates outside West Germanic ..." and is not connected to the Greek word. More probably, he writes, its etymon is PIE *bhragno "something broken."  The custom of using the plural to refer to the substance (literal or figurative), as opposed to the organ, dates from 16c. Figurative sense of "intellectual power" is from late 14c.; meaning "a clever person" is first recorded 1914. Brain teaser is from 1923. Brain stem first recorded 1879, from German. Brain drain is attested from 1963. An Old English word for "head" was brægnloca, which might be translated as "brain locker." In Middle English, Brainsick (O.E. brægenseoc) meant "mad, addled." 
brainstorm	ˈbreɪnˌstɔ:m	"brilliant idea, mental excitement, fit of mental application," 1849, from brain (n.) + figurative use of storm (n.). As a verb, recorded from 1920s. Related: Brainstormed; brainstorming.

brandling	ˈbrændlɪŋ	 
brash	bræʃ	1824, of obscure origin, originally Amer.Eng.; perhaps akin to 16c. Scottish brash "attack, assault," or Fr. breche "fragments," especially of ice, from a Germanic source (cf. O.H.G. brehha "breach," from brehhan "to break"), or to Ger. brechen "to vomit."
brashness	ˈbræʃnɪs	 
brass	brɑ:s	O.E. bræs "brass, bronze," originally in reference to an alloy of copper and tin (now bronze), later and in modern use an alloy of two parts copper, one part zinc. A mystery word, with no known cognates beyond English. Perhaps akin to Fr. brasser "to brew," since it is an alloy. It also has been compared to O.Swed. brasa "fire," but no sure connection can be made. Yet another theory connects it with L. ferrum "iron," itself of obscure origin.  As brass was unknown in antiquity, use of the word in Bible translations, etc., likely means "bronze." The Romans were the first to deliberately make it. Words for "brass" in other languages (e.g. Ger. Messing, O.E. mæsling, Fr. laiton, It. ottone) also tend to be difficult to explain. The meaning "effrontery, impudence" is from 1620s. Slang sense of "high officials" is first recorded 1899. The brass tacks that you get down to (1897) are probably the ones used to measure cloth on the counter of a dry goods store, suggesting precision. Slang brass balls "toughness, courage" (emphatically combining two metaphors for the same thing) attested by 1960s.

O.Ir. bratt "cloak, cloth"). The modern meaning is perhaps from notion of "child's apron." Hollywood Brat Pack (modeled on 1950s Rat Pack) is from 1985.
brattish	ˈbrætiʃ	 
bravado	brəˈvɑ:dəʊ	1580s, from Fr. bravade "bragging, boasting," from It. bravata "bragging, boasting" (16c.), from bravare "brag, boast, be defiant," from bravo (see brave). Influenced in form by Spanish words ending in -ado.

brazen	ˈbreɪzən	O.E. bræsen "of brass," from bræs "brass" (see brass) + -en (2). The figurative sense of "hardened in effrontery" is 1570s (in brazen-face), perhaps suggesting a face unable to show shame (see brass). To brazen it out "face impudently" is from 1550s.
breach	bri:tʃ	O.E. bryce "breach, fracture, a breaking," from brecan (see break), influenced by O.Fr. breche "breach, opening, gap," from Frankish; both from P.Gmc. *brecho, *bræko "broken," from PIE root *bhreg- "to break" (see fraction). Figurative sense of "a breaking of rules, etc." was in O.E. Breach of contract is at least from 1660s.
breadth	bredθ	1520s, alteration of brede "breadth," from O.E. brædu "breadth, width, extent," from bræd; probably by analogy with long/length.
breadwinner	ˈbredˌwɪnə	also bread-winner, "one who supplies a living for others, especially a family," 1821, from bread (probably in a literal sense) + winner. Attested slightly earlier (1818) in sense "skill or art by which one makes a living." Not too far removed from the image at the root of lord.

Hals- und Beinbruch "break your neck and leg," and It. in bocca al lupo. Evidence of a highly superstitious craft (also see Macbeth).

bring	briŋ	O.E. bringan "to bring, bring forth, produce, present, offer" (p.t. brohte, pp. broht), from P.Gmc. *brenganan (cf. O.Fris. brenga; M.Du. brenghen; O.H.G. bringan; Goth. briggan); no exact cognates outside Germanic, but it appears to be from PIE root *bhrengk-, compound based on root *bher- (1) "to carry" (cf.

bucket	ˈbʌkit	mid-13c., from Anglo-Norm. buquet "bucket, pail," influenced by or dim. of O.E. buc "pitcher, bulging vessel," originally "belly" (buckets were formerly of leather as well as wood), from P.Gmc. *bukaz, from PIE *bhou-, variant of root *bheu- "to grow, swell." Kick the bucket (1785) perhaps is from unrelated O.Fr. buquet "balance," a beam from which slaughtered animals were hung; perhaps reinforced by the notion of suicide by hanging.
buckle	ˈbʌkl	late 14c., bokelen, "to fasten with a buckle," from buckle (n.). Related: Buckled; buckling. Meaning "bend out of shape" (1520s), "bend under strong pressure" (1590s; figurative from 1640s) are perhaps a separate borrowing from M.Fr. boucler "to bulge."
bucolic	bju:ˈkɔlɪk	1610s, earlier bucolical (1520s), from L. bucolicus, from Gk. boukolikos "pastoral, rustic," from boukolos "cowherd, herdsman," from bous "cow" + -kolos "tending," related to L. colere "to till (the ground), cultivate, dwell, inhabit" (the root of colony).
bud	bʌd	late 14c., budde, origin unknown, perhaps from O.Fr. boter "push forward, thrust," itself a Germanic word (cf. Du. bot "bud," O.S. budil "bag, purse," Ger. Beutel), or from O.E. budd "beetle." The verb is c.1400.
budge	bʌdʒ	1580s, from M.Fr. bougier "to move, stir" (Mod.Fr. bouger), from V.L. *bullicare "to bubble, boil" (hence, "to be in motion"), from L. bullire "to boil" (see boil (v.)).
budget	ˈbʌdʒit	early 15c., "leather pouch," from M.Fr. bougette, dim. of O.Fr. bouge "leather bag, wallet, pouch," from L. bulga "leather bag," of Gaulish origin (cf. O.Ir. bolg "bag," Bret. bolc'h "flax pod"), from PIE *bhelgh- (see belly). Modern financial meaning (1733) is from notion of treasury minister keeping his fiscal plans in a wallet. The verb in this sense is from 1884. Related: Budgeted; budgeting. Another 18c. transferred sense was to "a bundle of news," hence the use of the word as the title of some newspapers.
budworm	ˈbʌdˌwɜ:m	 
buff	bʌf	1570s, buffe leather, from M.Fr. buffle "buffalo" (15c., via It. from L. bufalus; see see buffalo). The color term comes from the hue of buffalo hides (later ox hides); association of "hide" and "skin" led c.1600 to in the buff, and use of buff or suede to polish metal led to sense of verb "to polish with a buff" (1885). Related: Buffed; buffing. Buff-colored uniforms of N.Y.C. volunteer firefighters since 1820s led to meaning "enthusiast" (1903).The Buffs are men and boys whose love of fires, fire-fighting and firemen is a predominant characteristic. [N.Y. "Sun," Feb. 4, 1903] Adj. meaning "well-built, hunky" is from 1980s, from sense "polish, make attractive."
buffalo	ˈbʌfələu	city in western New York state, U.S., of disputed origin (there never were buffalo thereabouts), perhaps from the name of a native chief, or a corruption of Fr. beau fleuve "beautiful river." Buffalo wings finger food so called because the recipe was invented in Buffalo, N.Y., (1964, at Frank & Teressa's Anchor Bar on Main Street).
buffer	ˈbʌfə	1835, from obsolete verb buff "make a dull sound when struck" (mid-16c.), from O.Fr. buffe "a blow;" hence "something that absorbs a blow."
buffet	ˈbʌfit	"table," 1718, from Fr. bufet "bench, stool, sideboard," 12c., of uncertain origin. Sense extended 1888 to "meal served from a buffet."
buffoon	bəˈfu:n	1540s, "type of pantomime dance," 1580s, "clown," from M.Fr. bouffon (16c.), from It. buffone "jester," from buffare "to puff out the cheeks," a comic gesture, of echoic origin. Also cf. -oon.
buffoonery	 	1620s; see buffoon + -ery.
bug	bʌɡ	"to annoy, irritate," 1949, probably from bug (n.) and a reference to insect pests. Sense of "equip with a concealed microphone" is from 1919. Related: Bugged; bugging.
bugaboo	ˈbʌɡəbu:	1843, earlier buggybow (1740), probably an alteration of bugbear (see bug), but connected by Chapman ["Dictionary of American Slang"] with Bugibu, demon in the O.Fr. poem "Aliscans" from 1141, which is perhaps of Celtic origin (cf. Cornish bucca-boo, from bucca "bogle, goblin").
bugbear	ˈbʌgˌbeə	1580s, a sort of demon in the form of a bear that eats small children, also "object of dread" (whether real or not), from bug (n.) + bear (n.).
buggy	ˈbʌgi:	"light carriage," 1773, of unknown origin.
bulb	bʌlb	1560s, "an onion," from M.Fr. bulbe, from L. bulbus "bulb, onion," from Gk. bolbos "plant with round swelling on underground stem." Expanded by 1800 to "swelling in a glass tube" (thermometer bulb, light bulb, etc.).
bulge	bʌldʒ	c.1200, from O.Fr. bouge "wallet, pouch, leather bag" (see budget). Sense of "swelling" is first recorded 1620s. The verb is first recorded 1670s. Related: Bulged; bulging. Bilge (q.v.) may be a nautical variant.
bulk	bʌlk	late 15c., perhaps from bulk "framework projecting in the front of a shop" (1580s), which is perhaps from O.N. bolkr "beam, balk" (see balk).
bulky	ˈbʌlki:	mid-15c., from bulk + -y (2).
bull	bul	O.E. bulluc "young bull," from P.Gmc. *bulluka-, from the stem of bull (1). Now always a castrated bull reared for beef.
bulldoze	ˈbʊlˌdəʊz	"person who intimidates by violence," 1876, from bulldoze (q.v.). Meaning extended to ground-clearing caterpillar tractor in 1930.
bulletin	ˈbulitin	1765, from Fr. bulletin (16c.), modeled on It. bulletino, dim. of bulletta "document, voting slip," itself a dim. of L. bulla (see bull (2)). The word was used earlier in English in the Italian form (mid-17c.). Popularized by their use in the Napoleonic Wars as the name for dispatches sent from the front meant for the home public (which led to the proverbial expression as false as a bulletin). Bulletin board is from 1831.
bullion	ˈbʊljən	early 15c., "uncoined gold or silver," from Anglo-Norm. bullion "bar of precious metal," also "place where coins are made, mint," perhaps, through the notion of "melting," from O.Fr. boillir "to boil," from L. bullire "boil." But perhaps it is rather from O.Fr. bille "stick, block of wood."
bullish	ˈbʊlɪʃ	1560s, from bull (1) + -ish; stock market sense is from 1882.
bully	ˈbuli	1530s, originally "sweetheart," applied to either sex, from Du. boel "lover, brother," probably dim. of M.H.G. buole "brother," of uncertain origin (cf. Ger. buhle "lover"). Meaning deteriorated 17c. through "fine fellow," "blusterer," to "harasser of the weak" (1680s, from bully-ruffian, 1650s). Perhaps this was by influence of bull (n.1), but a connecting sense between "lover" and "ruffian" may be in "protector of a prostitute," which was one sense of bully (though not specifically attested until 1706). The verb is first attested 1710. The expression meaning "worthy, jolly, admirable" (esp. in 1864 U.S. slang bully for you!) is first attested 1680s, and preserves an earlier, positive sense of the word.
bullyrag	ˈbuliˌræɡ	 
bulwark	ˈbʊlwək	early 15c., from M.Du. bulwerke or M.H.G. bolwerc, from bole "plank, tree trunk" (from P.Gmc. *bul-, from PIE root *bhel- (2) "to blow, swell;" see bole) + werc "work." Figurative sense is from 1570s.
bum	bʌm	"buttocks," late 14c., "probably onomatopœic, to be compared with other words of similar sound and with the general sense of 'protuberance, swelling.' " [OED]
bumble	ˈbʌmbəl	"to flounder, blunder," 1530s, probably of imitative origin.
bumblebee	ˈbʌmbəlˌbi:	1520s, replacing M.E. humbul-be, altered by association with M.E. bombeln "to boom, buzz," echoic, from PIE echoic root *kem "to hum."
bummer	ˈbʌmə	"dissolute loafer, tramp," 1864, Amer.Eng., from bummer "loafer, idle person" (1855), possibly an extension of the British word for "backside" (similar development took place in Scotland, 1540), but more prob. from Ger. slang bummler "loafer," from bummeln "go slowly, waste time." Bum first appears in a German-American context, and bummer was popular in the slang of the North's army in Amer. Civil War (as many as 216,000 German immigrants in the ranks). Bum's rush "forcible ejection" first recorded 1910. Bummer "bad experience" is 1960s slang.
bump	bʌmp	1610s, verb and noun, perhaps from Scandinavian, probably echoic, original sense was "hitting" then of "swelling from being hit." Also has a long association with obsolete bum "to make a booming noise," which perhaps influenced surviving senses like bumper crop, for something full to the brim. To bump into "meet" is from 1880s; to bump off "kill" is 1908 in underworld slang.
bumper	ˈbʌmpə	1670s, "glass filled to the brim;" perhaps from notion of bumping as "large," or from a related sense of "booming" (see bump). Meaning "anything unusually large" is from 1759, slang. Meaning "buffer of a car" is from 1839, Amer.Eng., originally in reference to railway cars; 1926 of automobiles.
bumpkin	ˈbʌmpkɪn	"awkward country fellow," 1560s, probably from M.Du. bommekijn "little barrel," dim. of boom "tree." Apparently, though itself Dutch, it began as a derogatory reference to Dutch people as short and dumpy.
bumpkinly	 	 
bumptious	ˈbʌmpʃəs	"assertive," 1803, probably a humorous coinage on the pattern of fractious, etc.
bumpy	ˈbʌmpi:	1865, from bump + -y (2).  Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night. [Bette Davis ("Margo Channing"), "All About Eve," 1950]  Related: Bumpiness. 
bunch	bʌntʃ	early 14c., "protuberance on the body, swelling," perhaps echoic of the sound of hitting and connected to bump (cf., possibly, hump/hunch). As a verb meaning "to bulge out," from late 14c. The noun sense of "cluster" is mid-15c.; connection with the earlier sense is obscure, and this may be a separate word, perhaps through O.Fr. bouge (2), 15c., from Flemish boudje dim. of boud "bundle." The verb meaning "to gather up in a bunch" (trans.) is from 1828; that of "to crowd together" (intrans.) is from 1873. Related: Bunched; bunching.
bundle	ˈbʌndl	1620s, from bundle (n.); meaning "to wrap up in warm heavy clothes" is from 1893. Related: Bundled. Bundling (1781) "sharing a bed for the night, fully dressed, wrapped up with someone of the opposite sex" was a former local custom in Wales and New England.
bungalow	ˈbʌŋɡələu	1670s, from Gujarati bangalo, from Hindi bangla "low, thatched house," lit. "Bengalese," used elliptically for "house in the Bengal style."
bungle	ˈbʌŋgəl	1520s, origin obscure, perhaps a mix of boggle and bumble, or more likely from a Scandinavian word akin to Swed. bangla "to work ineffectually," from O.Swed. bunga "to strike" (cf. Ger. Bengel "cudgel," also "rude fellow"). Related: Bungled; bungler; bungling.
bungling	 	1520s, origin obscure, perhaps a mix of boggle and bumble, or more likely from a Scandinavian word akin to Swed. bangla "to work ineffectually," from O.Swed. bunga "to strike" (cf. Ger. Bengel "cudgel," also "rude fellow"). Related: Bungled; bungler; bungling.
bunk	bʌŋk	1758, from Scottish, "seat, bench," possibly a variant of banker "bench" (1670s; see bunk (1)). Of golf courses, first recorded 1824; meaning "dug-out fortification" is probably from World War I.
buoy	ˈbu:i:	1570s, perhaps from Sp. boyante, prp. of boyar "to float," from boya "buoy," from Du. boei (see buoy). Of personalities, etc., from c.1748.
buoyancy	ˈbɔɪənsi:	1713, from buoyant + -cy. Figurative sense (of spirits, etc.) is from 1819.
buoyant	ˈbɔɪənt	1570s, perhaps from Sp. boyante, prp. of boyar "to float," from boya "buoy," from Du. boei (see buoy). Of personalities, etc., from c.1748.
bureaucracy	bjuəˈrɔkrəsi	1818, from Fr. bureaucratie, from bureau "office," lit. "desk" (see bureau) + Gk. suffix -kratia denoting "power of;" coined by Fr. economist Jean Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay (1712-1759) on model of democratie, aristocratie.  That vast net-work of administrative tyranny ... that system of bureaucracy, which leaves no free agent in all France, except for the man at Paris who pulls the wires. [J.S. Mill, "Westminster Review" XXVIII, 1837] 
bureaucrat	ˈbjʊərəˌkræt	1839, from Fr. bureaucrate (19c.); see bureaucracy.  bureaucrat, &c. The formation is so barbarous that all attempt at self-respect in pronunciation may perhaps as well be abandoned. [Fowler] 
burgeon	ˈbɜ:dʒən	early 14c., from O.Fr. borjoner "to bud, sprout," from borjon "a bud, shoot, pimple," of uncertain origin, perhaps from Germanic. Related: Burgeoned; burgeoning.
burglar	ˈbə:ɡlə	1540s, shortened from M.E. burgulator, from Anglo-L. burglator (late 13c.), from O.Fr. burgeor "burglar," from M.L. burgator "burglar," from burgare "to break open, commit burglary," from L. burgus "fortress, castle," a Gmc. loan-word akin to borough. The intrusive -l- is perhaps from influence of L. latro "thief," originally "hired servant." The native word was burgh-breche.
burglarize	ˈbɜ:gləˌraɪz	1871, from burglary + -ize. Related: Burglarized; burglarizing. 
burial	ˈberiəl	"act of burying," late 13c.; earlier "tomb" (c.1200), false singular from O.E. byrgels "tomb," from byrgan "to bury" + suffix -els; a compound also found in O.S. burgisli, suggesting a P.Gmc. *burgisli-, from PIE *bhergh- "to hide, protect" (see bury). The Germanic suffix *-isli- (cf. O.E. hydels "hiding place," fætels "bag") became obsolete and was felt as a plural of the Latin-derived suffix -al forming nouns of action from verbs (survival, approval, etc.).
burlesque	bəˈlesk	1660s, "derisive imitation, grotesque parody," from Fr. burlesque (16c.), from It. burlesco, from burla "joke, fun, mockery," possibly ultimately from L.L. burra "trifle, nonsense," lit. "flock of wool." Modern sense of "variety show featuring striptease" is Amer.Eng., 1870. Originally (1857) "the sketches at the end of minstrel shows." As a verb, from 1670s.
burly	ˈbə:li	c.1300, perhaps from O.E. burlic "noble, stately," lit. "bowerly," fit to frequent a lady's apartment (see bower). Sense descended through "stout," and "sturdy" by 15c. to "heavily built." Another theory connects the original word to O.H.G. burlih "lofty, exalted," related to burjan "to raise, lift."
burning	ˈbɜ:nɪŋ	1670s, from Anglo-Fr. arsoun (late 13c.), O.Fr. arsion, from L.L. arsionem (nom. arsio) "a burning," noun of action from pp. stem of L. ardere "to burn," from PIE root *as- "to burn, glow" (see ash (1)). The Old English term was bærnet, lit. "burning;" and Coke has indictment of burning (1640).
burnish	ˈbɜ:nɪʃ	early 14c., from O.Fr. burniss- prp. stem of burnir, metathesis of brunir "to make brown/bright, polish," from brun "brown, polished," from a Germanic source (cf. O.H.G. brun, O.N. brunn "bright, polished, brown;" see brown).
burrow	ˈbʌrəu	"rabbit-hole, fox-hole, etc.," c.1300, borewe, from O.E. burgh "stronghold, fortress" (see borough); influenced by bergh "hill," and berwen "to defend, take refuge." The verb is first attested 1610s. Related: Burrowed; borrowing.
bursar	ˈbɜ:sə	"treasury," 1690s, from M.L. bursaria "treasurer's room"  (see bursar).

Business card first attested 1840; business letter from 1766.
bust	bʌst	variant of burst, 1764, Amer.Eng. The verb sense of "to burst" is first attested 1806; the slang meaning "demote" (especially in a military sense) is from 1918; that of "arrest" is from 1953 (earlier "to raid" from Prohibition). Originally "frolic, spree;" sense of "sudden failure" is from 1842. Phrase ______ or bust as an emphatic expression attested by 1851 in British depictions of Western U.S. dialect. Probably from earlier expression bust (one's) boiler, by late 1840s, a reference to steamboat boilers exploding when driven too hard.
bustle	ˈbʌsl	"padding in a skirt," 1788, perhaps from Ger. Buschel "bunch, pad," or may be a special use of bustle (1) with ref. to "rustling motion."

"slaughterer of goats" (12c., Mod.Fr. boucher), from bouc "male goat," from Frank. *bukk (see buck (n.1)) or Celtic *bukkos "he-goat." Related: Butchered; butchering. Figurative sense of "brutal murderer" is attested from 1520s. The verb is recorded from 1560s.
butt	bʌt	late 1980s, student slang, "objectionable person," from butt (n.1) + head; perhaps influenced by butterhead, 1960s black slang for one who is a disgrace to the community. Earlier, butthead meant simply "the butt end, bottom" of anything (1630s).
butter	ˈbʌtə	O.E. butere "butter," general W.Gmc. (cf. O.Fris., O.H.G. butera, Ger. Butter, Du. boter), an early loan-word from L. butyrum "butter" (cf. It. burro, O.Fr. burre, Fr. beurre), from Gk. boutyron, perhaps lit. "cow-cheese," from bous "ox, cow" + tyros "cheese;" but this may be a folk etymology of a Scythian word. The product was used from an early date in India, Iran and northern Europe, but not in ancient Greece and Rome. Herodotus described it (along with cannabis) among the oddities of the Scythians. The verb is O.E. buterian; figurative meaning "to flatter lavishly" is from 1816. Butter-fingered is attested from 1610s.
butterfly	ˈbʌtəflai	O.E. buttorfleoge, perhaps based on the old notion that the insects (or witches disguised as butterflies) consume butter or milk that is left uncovered. Or, less creatively, simply because the pale yellow color of many species' wings suggests the color of butter. Another theory connects it to the color of the insect's excrement, based on Du. cognate boterschijte. A fascinating overview of words for "butterfly" in various languages can be found here. The swimming stroke so called from 1936. Butterflies "light stomach spasms caused by anxiety" is from 1908.  The butterfly effect is a deceptively simple insight extracted from a complex modern field. As a low-profile assistant professor in MIT's department of meteorology in 1961, [Edward] Lorenz created an early computer program to simulate weather. One day he changed one of a dozen numbers representing atmospheric conditions, from .506127 to .506. That tiny alteration utterly transformed his long-term forecast, a point Lorenz amplified in his 1972 paper, "Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?" [Peter Dizikes, "The Meaning of the Butterfly," The Boston Globe, June 8, 2008] 
buttress	ˈbʌtrɪs	early 14c., from O.Fr. botrez "flying buttress," lit. "buttressed," pl. of boteret "support," from bouter "to thrust against," of Frankish origin (cf. O.N. bauta "to strike, beat"), from P.Gmc. *butan, from PIE root *bhau- "to strike" (see butt (v.)). The verb is from late 14c.
buxom	ˈbʌksəm	late 12c., buhsum "humble, obedient," from *buh- stem of O.E. bugen "to bow" + -som, for a total meaning "capable of being bent." Meaning progressed from "compliant, obliging," through "lively, jolly," "healthily plump, vigorous," to (in women, and perhaps influenced by lusty) "plump, comely" (1580s). Du. buigzaam, Ger. biegsam "flexible, pliable" hew closer to the original sense of the English cognate.
buzz	bʌz	late 15c., echoic of bees and other insects. Aviation sense of "fly low and close" is 1941. Noun meaning "a busy rumor" is attested from c.1600; that of "humming sound" is from 1640s. Meaning "pleasant sense of intoxication" first recorded 1935. The game of counting off, with 7 or multiples of it replaced by buzz is attested from 1864.

cabal	kəˈbæl	1520s, "mystical interpretation of the Old Testament," later "society, small group meeting privately" (1660s), from Fr. cabal, in both senses, from M.L. cabbala (see cabbala). Popularized in English 1673 as an acronym for five intriguing ministers of Charles II (Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale), which gave the word its sinister connotations.
cabbage	ˈkæbidʒ	mid-15c., caboge, from M.Fr. caboche "head" (in the Channel Islands, "cabbage"), from O.Fr. caboce "head," from L. caput "head" (see head). Introduced to Canada 1541 by Jacques Cartier on his third voyage. First written record of it in U.S. is 1660s. The decline of "ch" to "j" in the unaccented final syllable parallels the common pronunciation of spinach, sandwich, Greenwich, etc.
cabin	ˈkæbin	mid-14c., from O.Fr. cabane "hut, cabin," from O.Prov. cabana, from L.L. capanna "hut" (cf. Sp. cabana), of doubtful origin. Fr. cabine (18c.), It. cabino are English loan-words.

cabinet	ˈkæbinit	1540s, from M.Fr. cabinet "small room" (16c.), dim. of O.Fr. cabane "cabin" (see cabin); perhaps influenced by (or rather, from) It. gabbinetto, dim. of gabbia, from L. cavea "stall, stoop, cage, den for animals." Sense of "private room where advisors meet" (c.1600) led to modern political meaning (1640s); cf. board in its evolution from place where some group meets to the word for the group that meets there.

cactus	ˈkæktəs	c.1600, from L. cactus "cardoon," from Gk. kaktos, name of a type of prickly plant of Sicily (the Spanish artichoke), perhaps of pre-Hellenic origin. Modern meaning is 18c., because Linnaeus gave the name to a group of plants he thought were related to this but are not.
cadaver	kəˈdævə	c.1500, from L. cadaver "dead body (of men or animals)," probably from a perf. part. of cadere "to fall, sink, settle down, decline, perish" (see case (1)). Cf. Gk. ptoma "dead body," lit. "a fall;" poetic English the fallen "those who died in battle."
cadaverous	kəˈdævərəs	"looking like a corpse," early 15c., from L. cadaverosus "corpse-like," from cadaver (see cadaver).
cadence	ˈkeidəns	late 14c., "flow of rhythm in verse or music," from M.Fr. cadence, O.It. cadenza "conclusion of a movement in music," lit.

cadet	kəˈdet	c.1610, "younger son or brother," from Fr. cadet "military student officer," also, as an adj., "younger" (15c.), from Gascon capdet "captain, chief, youth of a noble family," from L.L. capitellum, lit. "little chief," hence, "inferior head of a family," dim. of L. caput "head" (see head). Younger sons from Gascon noble families apparently were sent to French court to serve as officers, which gave the word its military meaning. In English, the meaning "gentleman entering the military as a profession" is from 1650s, and that of "student at a military college" is from 1775.
cadge	kædʒ	"to beg" (1812), "to get by begging" (1848), of uncertain origin, perhaps a back formation from cadger "itinerant dealer with a pack-horse," mid-15c., which is perhaps from early 14c. cadge "to fasten, to tie," of unknown origin.
cafe	ˈkæfei	1802, from Fr. café "coffee, coffeehouse," from It. caffe "coffee" (see coffee).

The first public café might have been the one opened in Marseilles in 1660.
cafeteria	ˌkæfiˈtiəriə	1839, Amer.Eng. from Mexican Sp. cafeteria "coffee store," from café "coffee" (see coffee) + Sp. -tería "place where something is done" (usually business).

cajole	kəˈdʒəʊl	1640s, from Fr. cajoler "to cajole, wheedle, coax," perhaps a blend of M.Fr. cageoler "to chatter like a jay" (16c., from gajole, southern dim. of geai "jay"), and O.Fr. gaioler "to cage, entice into a cage" (see jail).
calamitous	kəˈlæmɪtəs	1540s, from Fr. calamiteux (16c.), from L. calamitosus "causing loss, destructive," from calamitas (see calamity).
calamity	kəˈlæmiti	early 15c., from M.Fr. calamite (14c.), from L. calamitatem (nom. calamitas) "damage, loss, failure; disaster, misfortune, adversity," origin obscure. Early etymologists associated it with calamus "straw," but it is perhaps from a lost root preserved in incolumis "uninjured."

Taken by the early Church for its register list of saints and their feast days. The -ar spelling in English is 17c. to differentiate it from the now obscure calender "cloth-presser."
caliber	ˈkæləbə	1560s, "degree of merit or importance," from M.Fr. calibre (late 15c.), apparently ultimately from Arabic qalib "a mold for casting." Arabic also used the word in the sense "mold for casting bullets," which is the original literal meaning in English, though the earliest cited sense is a figurative one. Meaning "inside diameter of a gun barrel" is attested from 1580s. Barnhart remarks that Sp. calibre, It. calibro "appear too late to act as intermediate forms" between the Arabic word and the French.

Gk. kelein "to bewitch, seduce, beguile," Goth. holon "to deceive," O.N. hol "praise, flattery," O.E. hol "slander," holian "to slander").

camp	kæmp	W.Gmc. *kampo-z, an early loan from L. campus "open field, level space" (cf. Fr. champ; see campus), especially "open space for military exercise." Originally borrowed as O.E. camp "contest," this was obsolete by mid-15c. Meaning "place where an army lodges temporarily" is a later reborrowing (1520s), from Fr. camp, from It. campo, from the same L. source. Transferred to non-military senses 1550s. Meaning "body of adherents of a doctrine or cause" is 1871. The verb meaning "to encamp" is from 1540s. Camp-follower first attested 1810.

canard	kəˈnɑ:d	before 1850, from Fr. canard "a hoax," lit. "a duck" (from O.Fr. quanart, probably echoic of a duck's quack); said by Littré to be from the phrase vendre un canard à moitié "to half-sell a duck," thus, from some long-forgotten joke, "to cheat." 
canary	kəˈneəri:	type of small songbird, 1650s (short for Canary-bird, 1570s), from Fr. canarie, from Sp. canario "canary bird," lit. "of the Canary Islands," from L.

cancer	ˈkænsə	O.E. cancer "spreading sore, cancer" (also canceradl), from L. cancer "a crab," later, "malignant tumor," from Gk. karkinos, which, like the Modern English word, has three meanings: crab, tumor, and the zodiac constellation (late 14c. in English), from PIE root *qarq- "to be hard" (like the shell of a crab); cf. Skt. karkatah "crab," karkarah "hard;" and perhaps cognate with PIE root *qar-tu- "hard, strong," source of English hard. Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen, among others, noted similarity of crabs to some tumors with swollen veins. Meaning "person born under the zodiac sign of Cancer" is from 1894. The sun being in Cancer at the summer solstice, the constellation had association in Latin writers with the south and with summer heat. Cancer stick "cigarette" is from 1959.

candidature	ˈkændɪdɪtʃə	 
candle	ˈkændl	O.E. candel "lamp, lantern, candle," an early ecclesiastical borrowing from L. candela "a light, torch, candle made of tallow or wax," from candere "to shine," from PIE root *kand- "to glow, to shine, to shoot out light" (cf. Skt. cand- "to give light, shine," candra- "shining, glowing, moon;" Gk. kandaros "coal;" Welsh cann "white;" M.Ir. condud "fuel"). Candles were unknown in ancient Greece (where oil lamps sufficed), but common from early times among Romans and Etruscans. Candles on birthday cakes seems to have been originally a German custom. To hold a candle to originally meant "to help in a subordinate capacity." To burn the candle at both ends is recorded from 1730.
candor	ˈkændə	"openness of mind, impartiality, frankness," c.1600, from L. candor "purity, openness," originally "whiteness," from candere "to shine, to be white" (see candle). Borrowed earlier in English (c.1500) with the L. literal sense "extreme whiteness."
candy	ˈkændi	late 13c., "crystalized sugar," from O.Fr. çucre candi "sugar candy," ultimately from Arabic qandi, from Pers. qand "cane sugar," probably from Skt. khanda "piece (of sugar)," perhaps from Dravidian (cf.

cane	kein	late 14c., from O.Fr. cane "reed, cane, spear" (13c., Mod.Fr. canne), from L. canna "reed, cane," from Gk. kanna, perhaps from Assyrian qanu "tube, reed" (cf. Hebrew qaneh, Arabic qanah "reed"), from Sumerian gin "reed." But Tucker finds this borrowing "needless" and proposes a native IE formation from a root meaning "to bind, bend."  Sense of "walking stick" in English is 1580s; verb meaning "to beat with a walking stick" is from 1660s. Related: Caned; caning.
canine	ˈkeɪnaɪn	"pointed tooth," late 14c., from L. caninus "of the dog," gen. of canis "dog," from PIE root *kwon- "dog" (cf.

The noun meaning "dog" is first recorded 1869.
canker	ˈkæŋkə	O.E. cancer, from L. cancer (see cancer); influenced in M.E. by O.N.Fr. cancre (Mod.Fr. chancre). The word was the common one for "cancer" until c.1700. Canker blossom is recorded from 1580s.
cannibal	ˈkænəbəl	1550s, from Sp. canibal "a savage, cannibal," from Caniba, Christopher Columbus' rendition of the Caribs' name for themselves (see Caribbean). The natives were believed to be anthropophagites. Columbus, seeking evidence that he was in Asia, thought the name meant the natives were subjects of the Great Khan. Shakespeare's Caliban (in "The Tempest") is a version of this word, with -n- and -l- interchanged, found in Hakluyt's "Voyages" (1599). The Spanish word had reached French by 1515.
cannibalism	ˈkænɪbɵlɪzɵm	1796, from cannibal + -ism. Perhaps from Fr. cannibalisme, from the same year.
cannon	ˈkænən	c.1400, "tube for projectiles," from O.Fr. canon (14c.), from It. cannone "large tube," augmentive of L. canna "reed, tube" (see cane). Cannon fodder (1891) translates Ger. kanonenfutter (cf. Shakespeare's food for powder in "I Hen. IV"). Spelling not differentiated from canon till c.1800. Cannon ball is from 1660s.
canny	ˈkæni:	1630s, Scottish and northern England formation from can (v.) in its sense of "know how to;" lit. "knowing," hence, "careful." Often used superciliously of Scots by their southern neighbors, implying "thrift and an eye to the main chance."

The same word (canape) in French, Spanish, and Portuguese now means "sofa, couch." Italian canape is a French loan word.
canorous	kəˈnɔ:rəs	 
cant	kænt	"insincere talk," 1709, earlier it was slang for "whining of beggars" (1640s), from a verb in this sense (1560s), from O.N.Fr. canter (O.Fr. chanter) "to sing, chant," from L. cantare, frequentative of canere "to sing" (see chant). Sense in English developed after 1680 to mean the jargon of criminals and vagabonds, thence applied contemptuously by any sect or school to the phraseology of its rival.
cantankerous	kænˈtæŋkərəs	1772, said to be "a Wiltshire word," probably an alteration (influenced by raucous) of M.E. contakour "troublemaker" (c.1300), from Anglo-Fr. contec "discord, strife," from O.Fr. contechier, from con- "with" + teche, related to atachier "hold fast" (see attach).

canteen	kænˈti:n	c.1710, "store in a military camp," from Fr. cantine "sutler's shop" (17c.), from It. cantina "wine cellar, vault." Perhaps another of the many meanings, now obsolete, that were attached to L. canto "corner;" in this case, perhaps "corner for storage." A Gaulish origin also has been proposed. Extended to "refreshment room at a factory, school, etc." from 1870. Meaning "small tin for water or liquor, carried by soldiers on the march, campers, etc." is from 1744, from a sense in French.
canto	ˈkæntəu	1580s, from It. canto "song," from L. cantus "song" (see chant). As "a section of a long poem," used in Italian by Dante, in English first by Spenser.

The spelling with a double -s- dates from 16c. As a noun, attested from c.1600.

canyon	ˈkænjən	1834, from Mex.Sp. cañon, extended sense of Sp. cañon "a pipe, tube, gorge," from cano "a tube," from L. canna "reed" (see cane). But earlier spelling callon (1560s) might suggest a source in calle "street."

cape	keip	"promontory," late 14c., from M.Fr. cap, from L. caput "headland, head" (see head). The Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa has been the Cape since 1660s. Sailors called low cloud banks that could be mistaken for landforms on the horizon Cape fly-away (1769).
caper	ˈkeɪpə	late 14c., from L. capparis (cf. It. cappero, Fr. câpre, Ger. Kaper), from Gk. kapparis "the caper plant or its fruit," of uncertain origin. Arabic kabbar, Pers. kabar are from Greek.

capillary	ˈkæpəˌleri:	1650s (adj.), 1660s (n.), from L. capillaris "of hair," from capillus "hair" (of the head); probably related to caput "head." Borrowed earlier as capillar (14c.). Capillary attraction attested from 1813. Capillarity is recorded from 1830, from Fr. capillarité.
capital	ˈkæpitl	early 13c., from L. capitalis "of the head," hence "capital, chief, first," from caput (gen. capitis) "head" (see head). A capital crime (1520s) is one that affects the life or "head;" capital had a sense of "deadly, mortal" from late 14c. in English, a sense also found in Latin. The connection between "head" and "life, mortality" also existed in O.E.: e.g. heafodgilt "deadly sin, capital offense," heafdes þolian "to forfeit life." Capital punishment was in Blackstone (1765).

caprice	kəˈpri:s	1660s, from Fr. caprice "whim" (16c.), from It. capriccio "whim," originally "a shivering," possibly from capro "goat," with reference to frisking; but another theory connects the It. word with capo "head" + riccio "curl, frizzled," lit. "hedgehog" (from L. ericius). The notion in this case would be of the hair standing on end in horror, hence the person shivering in fear.
capricious	kəˈprɪʃəs	1590s, from Fr. capricieux (16c.), from It. capriccioso, from capriccio (see capriccio). Related: Capriciously; capriciousness.

Sense evolved from headings of legal indictments involving seizure ("Certificate of caption"), the word being taken to mean the beginning of any document; thus "heading of a chapter or section of an article" (1789), and, especially in U.S., "description or title below an illustration" (1919).
captious	ˈkæpʃəs	c.1400, capcyus, from M.Fr. captieux (15c.), from L. captiosus "fallacious," from captio (gen. captionis) "a deceiving, fallacious argument," lit. "a taking (in)," from captus, pp. of capere "to take, catch" (see capable).

The Gk. measure was the equivalent of the Roman siliqua, which was one-twentyfourth of a golden solidus of Constantine; hence the word took on a sense of "a proportion of one twentyfourth" and became a measure of gold purity (1550s). Eighteen carat gold is eighteen parts gold, six parts alloy. It is unlikely that the classical carat was ever a measure of weight for gold.

catch	kætʃ	from the title of Joseph Heller's 1961 novel. In widespread use only after release of movie based on the book in 1970. The "catch" is that a bomber pilot is insane if he flies combat missions without asking to be relieved from duty, and is thus eligible to be relieved from duty. But if he asks to be relieved from duty, that means he's sane and has to keep flying. There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. "That's some catch, that Catch-22," he observed."It's the best there is," Doc Daneeka agreed. See catch (n.).
catching	ˈkætʃɪŋ	late 14c., "device to hold a latch of a door," also "a trap;" also "a fishing vessel," from catch (v.). Meaning "that which is caught or worth catching" (especially of spouses) is from 1590s. Sense of "hidden cost, qualification, etc." is slang first recorded 1885.

Original sense of "accuse" weakened to "assert, name" by the time Aristotle applied kategoria to his 10 classes of things that can be named.  category should be used by no-one who is not prepared to state (1) that he does not mean class, & (2) that he knows the difference between the two ....

Vulgate also sometimes translated agape by L. dilectio, noun of action from diligere "to esteem highly, to love" (see diligence). Wyclif and the Rhemish version regularly rendered the Vulgate dilectio by 'love,' caritas by 'charity.' But the 16th c. Eng. versions from Tindale to 1611, while rendering agape sometimes 'love,' sometimes 'charity,' did not follow the dilectio and caritas of the Vulgate, but used 'love' more often (about 86 times), confining 'charity' to 26 passages in the Pauline and certain of the Catholic Epistles (not in I John), and the Apocalypse .... In the Revised Version 1881, 'love' has been substituted in all these instances, so that it now stands as the uniform rendering of agape. [OED]

Extension from dance to voice is because Attic drama arose from tales inserted in the intervals of the dance. In Attic tragedy, the khoros (of 15 or 24 persons) gave expression, between the acts, to the moral and religious sentiments evoked by the actions of the play.  When a Poet wished to bring out a piece, he asked a Chorus from the Archon, and the expenses, being great, were defrayed by some rich citizen (the khoregos): it was furnished by the Tribe and trained originally by the Poet himself" [Liddell & Scott] Originally in English used in theatrical sense; meaning of "a choir" first attested 1650s.

[I]n general, as now used, the term classical includes the composers active in instrumental music from somewhere about 1700 to say 1830. Hence the list includes among the great names those of Bach, his sons, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Clementi, Dussek, Pleyel, Cramer, etc. The next step beyond the term classical is "modern romantic," the composers of which school may be taken to include all the writers for pianoforte from about 1829 (when Mendelssohn published the first "Songs without Words") down to the present. The term romantic in this sense means strongly marked, extraordinary, intending to tell stories and the like. ["Music, Its Ideals and Methods," W.S.B. Mathews, 1897]  But already by 1880s it was acknowledged the term had a double sense: Music that had withstood the test of time, as well as music of a style contrasted to "romantic." Later (early 20c.) it was contrasted to jazz (in this sense more often with reference to the orchestras than to the music itself). Still later in contrast to popular music generally.

The confusion was less in O.E. when cleave (1) was a class 2 strong verb; but it has grown since cleave (1) weakened, which may be why both are largely superseded by stick and split.
cleaver	ˈkli:və	late 15c., "one who splits," agent noun from cleave (1). Originally "one who splits boards with a wedge instead of sawing;" attested as a surname from early 14c. Meaning "butcher's chopper" is from 1570s.

cliches	 	 
cliché	 	see cliche.
click	klik	1610s, from click (v.).
client	ˈklaiənt	1560s, "body of professed adherents," from Fr. clientèle (16c.), from L. clientela "relationship between dependent and patron, body of clients," from clientem (nom. cliens; see client). Meaning "customers" is from 1865, perhaps a reborrowing from French.
clientele	ˌklaɪənˈtel	1560s, "body of professed adherents," from Fr. clientèle (16c.), from L. clientela "relationship between dependent and patron, body of clients," from clientem (nom. cliens; see client). Meaning "customers" is from 1865, perhaps a reborrowing from French.
climacteric	klaɪˈmæktərɪk	c.1600 (adj.), 1620s (n.), from L. climactericus, from Gk. klimakterikos "of a critical period," from klimakter "rung of a ladder" (see climax). A critical stage in human life, a period supposed to be especially liable to change. By some, held to be the years that are multiples of 7 (7, 14, 21, etc.), by others only the odd multiples (7, 21, 35, etc.), and by still others the multiples of 9. The Great Climacteric was the 63rd year (7x9), supposed to be especially critical.
climactic	klaɪˈmæktɪk	1872, from climax, apparently on the analogy of syntax/syntactic.
climate	ˈklaimit	1983, in the modern "global warming" sense.
climatologist	ˌklaɪməˈtɔlədʒɪst	1843, from climate + -ology. Related: Climatologist (1886).

"ladder," from root of klinein "to slope," from PIE root *klei- "to lean" (see lean (v.)). The rhetorical meaning evolved in English through "series of steps by which a goal is achieved," to "escalating steps," to (1789) "high point," a usage credited by the OED to "popular ignorance." The meaning "sexual orgasm" is recorded by 1880 (also in terms such as climax of orgasm), said to have been promoted from c.1900 by birth-control pioneer Marie Stopes (1880-1958) and others as a more accessible word than orgasm.
clime	klaim	1540s, chiefly poetic shortening of climate.
clinch	klintʃ	early 14c., "person or thing that clinches" (i.e., secures nails by bending down or riveting the pointed end), late 15c. as a class of shipyard worker; agent noun from clinch. As a type of nail, from 1735; as a conclusive statement, argument, etc., 1737.

clinging	ˈklɪŋɪŋ	âto remain clinging,â 1860; as a command to be patient, wait a minute, from 1936, originally in telephone conversations.
clinic	ˈklinik	1620s, from Fr. clinique (17c.), from L. clinicus "physician that visits patients in their beds," from Gk. klinike (techne) "(practice) at the sickbed," from klinikos "of the bed," from kline "bed, couch, that on which one lies," from suffixed form of PIE root *kli- "lean, slope" (see lean (v.)). An adjective originally in English, then "sick person;" sense of "hospital" is 1884, from Ger. Klinik, itself from Fr. clinique. The modern sense is thus reversed from the classical, when the "clinic" came to the patient. 
clinical	ˈklɪnɪkəl	1780, "pertaining to hospital patients or hospital care," from clinic + -al (2). Meaning "coldly dispassionate" (like a medical report) is recorded from 1928. Related: Clinically.

clipper	ˈklɪpə	late 14c., "a sheepshearer;" early 15c., "a barber;" c.1300 as a surname; from M.E. clippen "shorten" (see clip (1)). The type of fast sailing ship so called from 1823 (in Cooper's "The Pilot"), probably from clip (1) in sense of "to move or run rapidly," perhaps influenced by M.Du. klepper "swift horse," echoic (Clipper appears as the name of a race horse in 1831). Perhaps originally simply "fast ship," regardless of type:  Well, you know, the Go-along-Gee was one o' your flash Irish cruisers -- the first o' your fir-built frigates -- and a clipper she was! Give her a foot o' the sheet, and she'd go like a witch--but somehow o'nother, she'd bag on a bowline to leeward. ["Naval Sketch-Book," by "An officer of rank," London, 1826]  The early association of the ships was with Baltimore, Maryland. In late 18c., the word principally meant "one who cuts off the edges of coins" for the precious metal.
clipping	ˈklɪpɪŋ	early 13c., "clasping, embracing," from clip (2). Meaning "an article cut from a newspaper" is from 1857, from clip (1). Sense of "a small piece cut off" is from late 15c.
clique	kli:k	1711, from Fr. clique, originally  (14c.) "a sharp noise," from O.Fr. cliquer "click, clatter, crackle, clink," 13c., echoic. Apparently this word was at one time treated as the equivalent of claque (q.v.) and partook of that word's theatrical sense.
cloak	kləuk	late 13c., from O.N.Fr. cloque (O.Fr. cloche) "travelling cloak," from M.L. clocca "travelers' cape," lit. "a bell," so called from the garment's bell-like appearance (see bell; the word is thus a doublet of clock). Cloak and dagger (1806) translates Fr. de cape et d'épée.
clockwise	ˈklɔkwaiz	also clock-wise, 1879, from clock (n.) + wise (n.).
clod	klɔd	"lump of earth or clay," O.E. clod- (in clod-hamer "field-goer"), from P.Gmc. *kludda-, from PIE *gleu- (see clay). Synonymous with clot until 18c. Meaning "person" ("mere lump of earth") is from 1590s; that of "blockhead" is from c.1600. It also was a verb in M.E., meaning both "to coagulate, form into clods" and "to break up clods after plowing."
clog	klɔɡ	late 14c., "hinder," originally by fastening a block of wood to something, from clog (n.). Meaning "choke up" is 17c. Related: Clogged; clogging.

Related: Closely. Close call is 1881; close shave is 1834. Close-up (n.) in photography, etc., is from 1913. Close-minded is attested from 1818. 

closed-minded	 	1753, originally nautical, and reflecting the confusion of close (v.) and close (adj.); "now understood of proximity, but orig. 'closed' space on ship-board where last stand could be made against boarders" [Weekley]. Cf. also closed-minded, a variant of close-minded attested from 1880s, with a sense of "shut" rather than "tight."
closet	ˈklɔzit	late 14c., from O.Fr. closet "small enclosure, private room," dim. of clos, from L. clausum "closed space," from neut. pp. of claudere "to shut" (see close (v.)). In Matt. vi:6 used to render L. cubiculum "bedchamber, bedroom," Gk. tamieion "chamber, inner chamber, secret room;" thus originally in English "a private room for study or prayer;" modern sense of "small side-room for storage" is first recorded 1610s. The adjective is from 1680s, "private, secluded;" meaning "secret, unknown" recorded from 1952, first of alcoholism, but by 1970s used principally of homosexuality; the phrase come out of the closet "admit something openly" first recorded 1963, and lent new meanings to the word out.
closure	ˈkləʊʒə	late 14c., "a barrier, a fence," from O.Fr. closure "enclosure; that which encloses, fastening, hedge, wall, fence," also closture "barrier, division; enclosure, hedge, fence, wall" (12c., Mod.Fr. clôture), from L. clausura "lock, fortress, a closing" (cf. It. chiusura), from pp. stem of claudere "to close" (see close (v.)). Sense of "act of closing, bringing to a close" is from early 15c. Sense of "tendency to create ordered and satisfying wholes" is 1924, from Gestalt psychology.
clot	klɔt	O.E. clott, akin to Du. kloot "ball," Ger. Klotz "lump, block;" probably related to cleat and clod. The verb is early 15c.; of fluids from 1590s. Related: Clotted; clotting.
clothesline	ˈkləʊzˌlaɪn	1830, from clothes + line (n.). As a kind of high tackle in U.S. football (the effect is similar to running into a taut clothesline) attested by 1970; as a verb by 1959.
clothing	ˈkləuðiŋ	c.1200, from prp. of clothe.
cloture	ˈkləutʃə	1871, the French word for "the action of closing," applied to debates in the French Assembly, then to the House of Commons and U.S. Congress, from Fr. clôture, from O.Fr. closture (see closure).  In foreign countries the Clôture has been used notoriously to barricade up a majority against the "pestilent" criticism of a minority, and in this country every "whip" and force is employed by the majority to re-assert its continued supremacy and to keep its ranks intact whenever attacked. How this one-sided struggle to maintain solidarity can be construed into "good for all" is inexplicable in the sense uttered. ["The clôture and the Recent Debate, a Letter to Sir J. Lubbock," London, 1882]   
cloudburst	ˈklaʊdˌbɜ:st	1817, Amer.Eng., from cloud (n.) + burst (n.). Parallels Ger. Wolkenbruch.

Sense of "a blow" is from early 14c., first in a verbal sense, "to beat, strike;" perhaps somehow from the "patch" sense. Sense of "personal influence" is 1958, on the notion of "punch, force."
clown	klaun	c.1600, from clown (n.); colloquial sense of "to behave inappropriately" (e.g. clown around, 1932) attested by 1928, perhaps originally in music performance slang. Related: Clowned; clowning.

The meaning âfill to a sateity, overfillâ is attested for accloy from late 14c. Accloye is a hurt that cometh of shooing, when a Smith driveth a nail in the quick, which make him to halt. [Edward Topsell, âThe History of Four-footed Beasts,â 1607]
cloying	ˈklɔɪɪŋ	 
clue	klu:	"to inform someone of the important facts," usually with in, 1934, from clue (n.). Related: Clued; cluing. Earlier in 19c. sailing, "to man clue lines so as to force a yard down on the mast cap."

Sense of "economy or tourist class" is from 1949. Meaning "instructor/trainer" is c.1830 Oxford University slang for a tutor who "carries" a student through an exam; athletic sense is 1861.

coastland	ˈkəustlænd	 
coat	kəut	early 14c., "outer garment," from O.Fr. cote "coat, robe, tunic, overgarment," from a Germanic source, perhaps Frank. *kotta "coarse cloth" (cf.

cob	kɔb	a word or set of identical words with a wide range of meanings, many seeming to derive from notions of "heap, lump, rounded object," also "head" and its metaphoric extensions. With cognates in other Germanic languages; of uncertain origin and development. "The N.E.D. recognizes eight nouns cob, with numerous sub-groups. Like other monosyllables common in the dial[ect] its hist[ory] is inextricable" [Weekley]. In the latest print edition, the number stands at 11. Some senses are probably from O.E. copp "top, head," others probably from O.N. kubbi or Low German, all perhaps from a P.Gmc. base *kubb- "something rounded." Among the earliest attested English senses are "headman, chief," and "male swan," both early 15c., but the surname Cobb (1066) suggests O.E. used a form of the word as a nickname for "big, leading man." The "corn shoot" sense is attested by 1680s.

cobbler	ˈkɔblə	late 13c., cobelere "one who mends shoes," of uncertain origin. It and cobble (v.) "evidently go together etymologically" [OED], but the historical record presents some difficulties. "The cobbler should stick to his last" (ne sutor ultra crepidam) is from the anecdote of Greek painter Apelles.   On one occasion a cobbler noticed a fault in the painting of a shoe, and remarking upon it to a person standing by, passed on. As soon as the man was out of sight Apelles came from his hiding-place, examined the painting, found that the cobbler's criticism was just, and at once corrected the error. ... The cobbler came by again and soon discovered that the fault he had pointed out had been remedied; and, emboldened by the success of his criticism, began to express his opinion pretty freely about the painting of the leg! This was too much for the patience of the artist, who rushed from his hiding place and told the cobbler to stick to his shoes. [William Edward Winks, "Lives of Illustrious Shoemakers," London, 1883]  [The quote is variously reported: Pliny ("Natural History" XXXV.x.36) has ne supra crepidam judicaret, while Valerius Maximus (VIII.xiii.3) gives supra plantam ascendere vetuit.]
cocaine	kəuˈkein	1874, from Modern Latin cocaine (1856), coined by Albert Niemann of Gottingen University from coca (from Quechua cuca) + chemical suffix -ine (2). A medical coinage, the drug was used 1870s as a local anaesthetic for eye surgery, etc. "It is interesting to note that although cocaine is pronounced as a disyllabic word it is trisyllabic in its formation." [Flood]
cocoa	ˈkəʊkəʊ	powder from cacao seeds, 1707, corruption (by influence of coco) of cacao. The printing of Johnson's dictionary ran together the entries for coco and cocoa, fostering a confusion that never has been undone.

The verb is from 1986, "to stay inside and be inactive," as is the noun sense of "one's interior comfort place."  A lady with an enchanting name, Faith Popcorn, has identified a menacing new American behavior that she gives the sweet name of 'cocooning.' It threatens the nation's pursuit of happiness, sometimes called the economy. [George Will, April 1987]  Also see -oon.
coda	ˈkəʊdə	"concluding passage in a musical composition," 1753, from L. cauda "tail of an animal."

The classical sense was "amusing play or performance," which is similar to the modern one, but in the Middle Ages the word came to mean poems and stories generally (albeit ones with happy endings), and the earliest English sense is "narrative poem" (cf. Dante's "Commedia").  Generalized sense of "quality of being amusing" dates from 1877.  Comedy aims at entertaining by the fidelity with which it presents life as we know it, farce at raising laughter by the outrageous absurdity of the situation or characters exhibited, & burlesque at tickling the fancy of the audience by caricaturing plays or actors with whose style it is familiar. [Fowler]

conservative	kənˈsə:vətiv	late 14c., conservatyf, from M.Fr. conservatif, from L.L. conservativus, from L. conservatus, pp. of conservare (see conserve). As a modern political tradition, conservatism traces to Edmund Burke's opposition to the French Revolution (1790), but the word conservative is not found in his writing. It was coined by his French disciples, (e.g. Chateaubriand, who titled his journal defending clerical and political restoration "Le Conservateur"). Conservative as the name of a British political faction first appeared in an 1830 issue of the "Quarterly Review," in an unsigned article sometimes attributed to John Wilson Croker. It replaced Tory (q.v.) by 1843, reflecting both a change from the pejorative name (in use for 150 years) and repudiation of some reactionary policies. Extended to similar spirits in other parties from 1845.Strictly speaking, conservatism is not a political system, but rather a way of looking at the civil order. The conservative of Peru ... will differ greatly from those of Australia, for though they may share a preference for things established, the institutions and customs which they desire to preserve are not identical. [Russell Kirk (1918-1994)] Phrases such as a conservative estimate make no sense etymologically. The noun is attested from 1831, originally in the British political sense.

"to observe the stars," from com- "with" (see com-) + sidus (gen. sideris) "constellation" (see sidereal). Perhaps a metaphor from navigation, but more likely reflecting Roman obsession with divination by astrology. Tucker doubts the connection with sidus, however, since it is "quite inapplicable to desiderare," and suggests derivation instead from the PIE root of English side meaning "stretch, extend," and a sense for the full word of "survey on all sides" or "dwell long upon."

The modern military sense (1704) is from Fr. corps d'armée (16c.), picked up in English during Marlborough's campaigns.

cosmos	ˈkɔzməs	c.1200 (but not popular until 1848, as a translation of Humboldt's Kosmos), from Gk. kosmos "order, good order, orderly arrangement," a word with several main senses rooted in those notions: The verb kosmein meant generally "to dispose, prepare," but especially "to order and arrange (troops for battle), to set (an army) in array;" also "to establish (a government or regime);" "to deck, adorn, equip, dress" (especially of women). Thus kosmos had an important secondary sense of "ornaments of a woman's dress, decoration" (cf. kosmokomes "dressing the hair") as well as "the universe, the world." Pythagoras is said to have been the first to apply this word to "the universe," perhaps originally meaning "the starry firmament," but later it was extended to the whole physical world, including the earth. For specific reference to "the world of people," the classical phrase was he oikoumene (ge) "the inhabited (earth)." Septuagint uses both kosmos and oikoumene. Kosmos also was used in Christian religious writing with a sense of "worldly life, this world (as opposed to the afterlife)," but the more frequent word for this was aion, lit. "lifetime, age." 
cossack	ˈkɔsæk	1590s, from Rus. kozak, from Turk. kazak "adventurer, guerilla, nomad," from qaz "to wander." The same Turkic root is the source of the people-name Kazakh and the nation of Kazakhstan.
cosset	ˈkɔsɪt	1650s, "to fondle, caress, indulge," from a noun (1570s) meaning "lamb brought up as a pet" (applied to persons from 1590s), perhaps from O.E. cot-sæta "one who dwells in a cot." Related: Coseted; coseting. Cf. Ger. Hauslamm, It. casiccio.

cotton	ˈkɔtən	as a deprecatory term first recorded in a Bugs Bunny cartoon, but a similar noun meaning "contemptible person" dates to around 1919, perhaps with racist overtones that have faded over the years. Before mechanization, cotton picking was the most difficult labor on a cotton plantation.  I drove out to a number of the farms near Denison and found many very young white children working all day in the hot sun picking and dragging sacks of cotton. In one field the labor corps consisted of one woman and six children, one of them 5 years, one 6 years, one 7 years, one 9 years, and two about 11. The father was plowing. The 5 and 6 year olds worked all day as did the rest. The 7-year-old said he picked 50 pounds a day and the 9 year old 75 pounds. (A good picker averages several hundred a day.) School begins late on account of the cotton picking, but the children nearly all prefer school to the picking. Picking hours are long, hot, and deadly monotonous. While the very young children seem to enjoy it, very soon their distaste for it grows into all-absorbing hatred for all work. ["Field Notes of Lewis W. Hine, Child-Labor Conditions in Texas," report to U.S. Congressional Commission on Industrial Relations, 1916]  
couch	kautʃ	mid-14c., from O.Fr. couche (12c.) "a bed, lair," from coucher "to lie down," from L. collocare (see couch (v.)). Traditionally, a couch has the head end only raised, and only half a back; a sofa has both ends raised and a full back; a settee is like a sofa but may be without arms; an ottoman has neither back nor arms, nor has a divan, the distinctive feature of which is that it goes against a wall. Couch potato first recorded 1979.
cougar	ˈku:gə	1774, from Fr. couguar, Buffon's adaption (influenced by jaguar) of a word the Portuguese picked up in Brazil as çuçuarana, perhaps from Tupi susuarana, from suasu "deer" + rana "false." Another proposed source is Guarani guaçu ara. Evidently the cedillas dropped off the word before Buffon got it. Slang sense of "older woman (35-plus) who seeks younger males as sex partners" is attested by 2002; said in some sources to have originated in Canada, probably from some reference to predatory feline nature.
council	ˈkaunsl	early 12c., from Anglo-Fr. cuncile, from O.N.Fr. concilie (O.Fr. concile, 12c.) "assembly; council meeting; body of counsellors," from L. concilium "group of people, meeting," from com- "together" (see com-) + calare "to call" (see claim). Tendency to confuse it in form and meaning with counsel has been consistent since 16c.
counsel	ˈkaunsəl	early 13c., from O.Fr. counseil (10c.) "advice, counsel; deliberation, thought," from L. consilium "plan, opinion" (see consultation). As a synonym for "lawyer," first attested late 14c. The verb is recorded from late 13c., from O.Fr. conseiller "to advise, counsel," from L. consiliari. Related: Counseled.

countrified	ˈkʌntrifaid	1590s, "ignorant, dull," from Boeotia, district around Thebes in ancient Greece (said to have been so called for its cattle pastures), whose inhabitants were characterized as proverbially dull and countrified by their neighbors, the Athenians. The Boeotians presumably held reciprocal opinions, but their great writers, Plutarch and Pindar, though patriots, are full of praise for Athenian deeds and institutions.  Though his aim was to vindicate Boeotia, [Pindar] has probably done her a disservice, in that he has helped to immortalise the scurrilous proverb Βοιωτία ύς, which he wished to confute. ... If left to itself, the slander might have passed into oblivion long ago. [W. Rhys Roberts, "The Ancient Boeotians," 1895] 
coup	ku:	1640s, from Fr. coup d'étate,  lit. "stroke of the state" (see coup). Technically any sudden, decisive political act but popularly restricted to the overthrow of a government.

Association with witches arose in Scotland, but not popularized until Sir Walter Scott used it in this sense in "Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft" (1830).Ther vold meit bot sometymes a Coven .... Ther is threttein persones in ilk Coeven. [Crim. Trials Scot. III 606, 1662]
covenant	ˈkʌvənənt	c.1300, from O.Fr. covenant "agreement," originally prp. of covenir "agree, meet," from L. convenire "come together" (see convene). Applied in Scripture to God's arrangements with man, as a translation of L. testamentum, Gk. diatheke, both rendering Heb. berith (though testament is also used for the same word in different places). The verb is recorded from c.1300. Covenanter (1638), especially used of Scottish Presbyterians who signed the Solemn League and Covenant (1643) for the defense and furtherance of their cause.
cover	ˈkʌvə	mid-12c., from O.Fr. covrir (12c., Mod.Fr. couvrir) "to cover, protect, conceal, dissemble," from L.L. coperire, from L. cooperire "to cover over, overwhelm, bury," from com-, intensive prefix (see com-), + operire "to close, cover" (see weir).

Skt. gaus, Gk. bous, L. bov-, O.Ir. bo, Latvian guovs, Armenian gaus "cow," Slovak hovado "ox"), perhaps ultimately imitative of lowing (cf. Sumerian gu, Chinese ngu, ngo "ox"). In Germanic and Celtic, of females only; in most other languages, of either gender. Other "cow" words sometimes are from roots meaning "horn, horned," e.g. Lith. karve, O.C.S. krava.
coward	ˈkauəd	mid-13c., from O.Fr. coart "coward" (no longer the usual word in French, which has now in this sense poltron, from Italian, and lâche), from coe "tail," from L. coda, popular dialect variant of cauda "tail," of uncertain origin + -ard, an agent noun suffix denoting one that carries on some action or possesses some quality, with derogatory connotation (see -ard). The word probably reflects an animal metaphoric sense still found in expressions like turning tail and tail between legs. Coart was the name of the hare in Old French versions of "Reynard the Fox." It. codardo, Sp. cobarde are from French.  The identification of coward & bully has gone so far in the popular consciousness that persons & acts in which no trace of fear is to be found are often called coward(ly) merely because advantage has been taken of superior strength or position .... [Fowler]  As a surname (attested from 1255) it represents O.E. cuhyrde "cow-herd." Farmer has coward's castle "a pulpit," "Because a clergyman may deliver himself therefrom without fear of contradiction or argument."
cowardice	ˈkaʊədɪs	c.1300, from O.Fr. coardise (13c.), from coard, coart (see coward) + noun suffix -ise. Cowardice, as distinguished from panic, is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend the functioning of the imagination. [Ernest Hemingway, "Men at War," 1942]
cower	ˈkaʊə	c.1300, probably from M.L.G. *kuren "lie in wait" (Ger. kauern), or similar Scandinavian words meaning "to squat" and "to doze" (cf. O.N. kura, Dan., Norw. kure, Swed. kura). Thus unrelated to coward. Related: Cowered; cowering.
cowshed	ˈkauʃed	c.1300, perhaps from O.E. scoppa "booth or shed for trade or work" (rare), related to scypen "cowshed," from P.Gmc. *skoppan "small additional structure" (cf. O.H.G. scopf "building without walls, porch," Ger. dial. Scopf "porch, cart-shed, barn," Ger. Schuppen "a shed"), from root *skupp-. But it's likely that the M.E. word was acquired from O.Fr. eschoppe "booth, stall," which is a Germanic loan-word from the same root. Meaning "schoolroom equipped for teaching vocational arts" is from 1914, Amer.Eng. Sense of "matters pertaining to one's trade" is from 1814 (as in to talk shop, 1860). Shopping cart is recorded from 1956; shopping list first attested 1913; transferred and figurative use is from 1959.

crabbed	ˈkræbɪd	late 14c., lit. "resembling a crab," in reference to crookedness, from crab (1). Of taste "bitter, harsh," late 14c., from crab (2). Meaning "peevish" is attested from 1560s, in reference to a crab's combative disposition.
crack	kræk	slang, "crack cocaine addict," by 1986, from crack (n.) in the drug slang sense + head (n.). In earlier slang, crack-headed meant "crazy" (1796), from the literal sense of crack.

dagger	ˈdæɡə	late 14c., apparently from O.Fr. dague "dagger," from O.Prov. dague or It. daga, of uncertain origin; perhaps Celtic, perhaps from V.L. *daca "Dacian knife," from the Roman province in modern Romania. The ending is possibly the faintly pejorative -ard suffix. Attested earlier (1279) as a surname (Dagard, presumably "one who carried a dagger"). M.Du. dagge, Dan. daggert, Ger. Degen also are from French.

The Latin word evolved a legal meaning of "pronounce judgment upon." Theological sense is first recorded early 14c.; the optative expletive use likely is as old. Damn and its derivatives generally were avoided in print from 18c. to c.1930s (the famous line in the film version of "Gone with the Wind" was a breakthrough and required much effort by the studio).

Dampf "vapor;" O.N. dampi "dust"). Sense of "moisture, humidity" is first certainly attested 1706.

Cf. dependant.
descent	diˈsent	c.1300, from O.Fr. descente "descent, descendance, lineage," formed from descendre (see descend) on analogy of  French nouns like attente from attendre "to expect," vente "sale" from vendre "to sell," pente "slope" from pendre "to hang" (the etymological English word from Latin would be *descence). Figurative use is from late 14c. Meaning "action of descending," also "a downward slope" is from 1590s. Meaning "act of descending from an ancestor" is from mid-14c.

Sense of "waterless, treeless region" was in M.E. and gradually became the main meaning.

dial	ˈdaiəl	early 15c., "sundial," earlier "dial of a compass" (mid-14c.), apparently from M.L. dialis "daily," from L. dies "day" (see diurnal). The word perhaps was abstracted from a phrase such as M.L. rota dialis "daily wheel," and evolved to mean any round plate over which something rotates. Telephone sense is from 1879, which led to dial tone (1921), "the signal to begin dialing," which term soon might be the sole relic of the rotary phone. The verb is from 1650s, "to work with aid of a dial or compass;" telephone sense is from 1923. Related: Dialed; dialing.
dialect	ˈdaiəlekt	1570s, "form of speech of a region or group," from M.Fr. dialecte, from L. dialectus "local language, way of speaking, conversation," from Gk. dialektos "talk, conversation, speech;" also "the language of a country, dialect," from dialegesthai "converse with each other," from dia- "across, between" (see dia-) + legein "speak" (see lecture).

A word for "conversation between two persons" is the hybrid duologue (1864).

diaper	ˈdaɪəpə	mid-14c., "fabric with a repeated pattern of figures," from O.Fr. diaspre "ornamental cloth; flowered, patterned silk cloth," perhaps via M.L. diasprum from Medieval Gk. diaspros "thoroughly white," or perhaps "white interspersed with other colors," from dia- (see dia-) + aspros "white." Aspros originally meant "rough," and was applied to the raised parts of coins (among other things), and thus was used in Byzantine Greek to mean "silver coin," from which the bright, shiny qualities made it an adjective for whiteness. Modern sense of "underpants for babies" is continuous since 1837, but such usage has been traced back to 1590s. As a verb, from late 14c., "to put a small, repeated pattern on."

"a wearing away (of time)," from dia- "away" (see dia-) + tribein "to wear, rub," from PIE root *ter- "to rub, turn, twist" (see throw). Sense of "invective" is 1804, apparently from French.
dichotomy	daɪˈkɔtəmi:	c.1600, from Gk. dichotomia "a cutting in half," from dicha "in two, asunder" (related to dis "twice") + temnein "to cut" (see tome).
dicker	ˈdikə	"haggle, bargain in a petty way," 1802, Amer.Eng., perhaps from dicker (n.) "a unit or package of tens," especially hides (attested from late 13c.), perhaps from L. decuria "parcel of ten" (supposedly a unit of barter on the Roman frontier; cf. Ger. Decher "set of ten things"), from decem "ten" (see ten) on model of centuria from centum.

O.Ir. dith "end, death," O.C.S. daviti, Rus. davit' "to choke, suffer"). It has been speculated that O.E. had *diegan, from the same source, but it is not in any of the surviving texts and the preferred words were steorfan (see starve), sweltan (see swelter), wesan dead, also forðgan and other euphemisms. Languages usually don't borrow words from abroad for central life experiences, but "die" words are an exception, since they are often hidden or changed euphemistically out of superstitious dread. A Dutch euphemism translates as "to give the pipe to Maarten." Regularly spelled dege through 15c., and still pronounced "dee" by some in Lancashire and Scotland. Used figuratively (of sounds, etc.) from 1580s. Related: Died; dies.

The verb is late 14c., from O.Fr. dieter; meaning "to regulate oneself as to food" (especially against fatness) is from 1650s. An obsolete word for this is banting.

dinghy	ˈdɪŋi:	1810, from Hindi dingi "small boat," perhaps from Skt. drona-m "wooden trough," related to dru-s "wood, tree" (see tree). The spelling with -h- is to indicate a hard -g-.

It is obvious to any one who has been in charge of the interests of his country abroad that the day secrecy is abolished negotiations of any kind will become impossible. [Jules Cambon, "The Diplomatist" (transl. Christopher Rede Turner), 1931] 
diplomat	ˈdipləmæt	1813, from Fr. diplomate, a back formation from diplomatique (see diplomatic) on model of aristocrate from aristocratique.
diplomatic	ˌdipləˈmætik	1711, "pertaining to documents, texts, charters," from M.L. diplomaticus, from diplomat-, stem of diploma (see diploma). Meaning "pertaining to international relations" is recorded from 1787, apparently a sense evolved in 18c. from the use of diplomaticus in Mod.L. titles of collections of international treaties, etc., in which the word referred to the "texts" but came to be felt as meaning "pertaining to international relations." In the general sense of "tactful and adroit," it dates from 1826. Related: Diplomatically.

Transferred sense of "any funeral song" is from c.1500.
dirk	dɜ:k	c.1600, perhaps from Dirk, the proper name, which was used in Scandinavian for "a picklock." But the earliest spellings were dork, durk (Johnson, 1755, seems to be responsible for the modern spelling), and the earliest association is with Highlanders, however there seems to be no such word in Gaelic, where the proper name is biodag.

Diversity as a virtue in a nation is an idea from the rise of modern democracies in the 1790s, where it kept one faction from arrogating all power (but this was not quite the modern sense, as ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, etc. were not the qualities in mind):  The dissimilarity in the ingredients which will compose the national government, and still more in the manner in which they will be brought into action in its various branches, must form a powerful obstacle to a concert of views in any partial scheme of elections. There is sufficient diversity in the state of property, in the genius, manners, and habits of the people of the different parts of the Union, to occasion a material diversity of disposition in their representatives towards the different ranks and conditions in society.

Dutch	dʌtʃ	late 14c., used first of Germans generally, after c.1600 of Hollanders, from M.Du. duutsch, from O.H.G. duit-isc, corresponding to O.E. þeodisc "belonging to the people," used especially of the common language of Germanic people, from þeod "people, race, nation," from P.Gmc. *theudo "popular, national" (see Teutonic), from PIE root *teuta- "people" (cf. O.Ir. tuoth "people," O.Lith. tauta "people," O.Prus. tauto "country," Oscan touto "community").  As a language name, first recorded as L. theodice, 786 C.E. in correspondence between Charlemagne's court and the Pope, in reference to a synodical conference in Mercia; thus it refers to Old English. First reference to the German language (as opposed to a Germanic one) is two years later. The sense was extended from the language to the people who spoke it (in German, Diutisklant, ancestor of Deutschland, was in use by 13c.).  Sense narrowed to "of the Netherlands" in 17c., after they became a united, independent state and the focus of English attention and rivalry. In Holland, Duits (formerly duitsch) is used of the people of Germany. The M.E. sense survives in Pennsylvania Dutch, name of the people who immigrated from the Rhineland and Switzerland.  Since c.1600, Dutch (adj.) has been a "pejorative label pinned by English speakers on almost anything they regard as inferior, irregular, or contrary to 'normal' (i.e., their own) practice" [Rawson]. E.g. Dutch treat (1887), Dutch uncle (1838), etc. -- probably exceeded in such usage only by Indian and Irish -- reflecting first British commercial and military rivalry and later heavy German immigration to U.S.  The Dutch themselves spoke English well enough to understand the unsavory connotations of the label and in 1934 Dutch officials were ordered by their government to stop using the term Dutch. Instead, they were to rewrite their sentences so as to employ the official The Netherlands. [Rawson]  Dutch oven is from 1769; OED lists it among the words describing things from Holland, but perhaps it is here used in the slighting sense. Dutch elm disease (1927) so called because it was first discovered in Holland (caused by fungus Ceratocystis ulmi).

The verb is from O.E. deagian "to dye." Spelling distinction between dye and die was not firm till 19c.

Despite the undeniable power of man's antisocial passions, therefore, the individual may hope for improvement through his own efforts -- through education, participation in politics, activity in behalf of reform, but not through prayer.

fact-finding	ˈfæktˌfaindiŋ	c.1200, "inferior in quality;" early 13c., "wicked, evil, vicious," a mystery word with no apparent relatives in other languages.* Possibly from O.E. derogatory term bæddel and its dim. bædling "effeminate man, hermaphrodite, pederast," probably related to bædan "to defile." A rare word before 1400, and evil was more common in this sense until c.1700. Meaning "uncomfortable, sorry" is 1839, Amer.Eng. colloquial.  Comparable words in the other I.E. languages tend to have grown from descriptions of specific qualities, such as "ugly," "defective," "weak," "faithless," "impudent," "crooked," "filthy" (e.g. Gk. kakos, probably from the word for "excrement;" Rus. plochoj, related to O.C.S. plachu "wavering, timid;" Pers. gast, O.Pers. gasta-, related to gand "stench;" Ger. schlecht, originally "level, straight, smooth," whence "simple, ordinary," then "bad").  Comparative and superlative forms badder, baddest were common 14c.-18c. and used as recently as Defoe (but not by Shakespeare), but yielded to comp. worse and superl. worst (which had belonged to evil and ill).  As a noun, late 14c., "evil, wickedness." In U.S. place names, sometimes translating native terms meaning "supernaturally dangerous." Ironic use as a word of approval is said to be at least since 1890s orally, originally in Black Eng., emerging in print 1928 in a jazz context. It might have emerged from the ambivalence of expressions like bad nigger, used as a term of reproach by whites, but among blacks sometimes representing one who stood up to injustice, but in the U.S. West bad man also had a certain ambivalence:  These are the men who do most of the killing in frontier communities, yet it is a noteworthy fact that the men who are killed generally deserve their fate. [Farmer & Henley]  *Farsi has bad in more or less the same sense as the English word, but this is regarded by linguists as a coincidence. The forms of the words diverge as they are traced back in time (Farsi bad comes from M.Pers. vat), and such accidental convergences exist across many languages, given the vast number of words in each and the limited range of sounds humans can make to signify them. Among other coincidental matches with English are Korean mani "many," Chinese pei "pay," Nahuatl (Aztecan) huel "well," Maya hol "hole."

The diminutive winged beings so-called in children's stories seem to date from early 17c.  Yet I suspect that this flower-and-butterfly minuteness was also a product of ârationalization,â which transformed the glamour of Elfland into mere finesse, and invisibility into a fragility that could hide in a cowslip or shrink behind a blade of grass. It seems to become fashionable soon after the great voyages had begun to make the world seem too narrow to hold both men and elves; when the magic land of Hy Breasail in the West had become the mere Brazils, the land of red-dye-wood. [J.R.R. Tolkien," On Fairy-Stories," 1947]   The slang meaning "effeminate male homosexual" is first recorded 1895. Fairy ring is from 1590s.

feisty	ˈfaisti	1896, "aggressive, exuberant, touchy," Amer.Eng., with -y (2) + feist "small dog," earlier fice, fist (Amer.Eng., 1805); short for fysting curre "stinking cur," attested from 1520s, from M.E. fysten, fisten "break wind" (mid-15c.); related to O.E. fisting "stink," from P.Gmc. *fistiz- "a fart," said to be from PIE *pezd- (see fart), but there are difficulties.  The 1811 slang dictionary defines fice as "a small windy escape backwards, more obvious to the nose than ears; frequently by old ladies charged on their lap-dogs." Cf. also Dan. fise "to blow, to fart," and obsolete English aske-fise, "fire-tender," lit. "ash-blower" (early 15c.), from an unrecorded Norse source, used in M.E. for a kind of bellows, but originally "a term of reproach among northern nations for an unwarlike fellow who stayed at home in the chimney corner" [OED].
felicitate	fɪˈlɪsɪˌteɪt	1620s, âto render happy;â 1630s, âto reckon happy;â from L. felicitatus, pp. of felicitare "to make happy," from felicitas "fruitfulness, happiness," from felix (see felicity). Meaning "congratulate" is from 1630s. Related: Felicitated; felicitating.
felicitous	fɪˈlɪsɪtəs	1530s (implied in felicitously), from felicity + -ous.
felicity	fɪˈlɪsɪti:	late 14c., from O.Fr. felicite (14c.) "happiness," from L. felicitatem (nom. felicitas) "happiness, fertility," from felix (gen. felicis) "happy, fortunate, fruitful, fertile," from L. root *fe-, equivalent of PIE *dhe(i)- "to suck, suckle, produce, yield" (see fecund).
feline	ˈfi:ˌlaɪn	1680s, from L.L. felinus "of or belonging to a cat," from L. feles (gen. felis) "cat, wild cat, marten," of uncertain origin. As a noun, from 1861.
fell	fel	"cruel," late 13c., from O.Fr. fel "cruel, fierce, vicious," from M.L. fello "villain" (see felon). Phrase at one fell swoop is from "Macbeth."
fellowship	ˈfeləuʃip	c.1200, feolahschipe "companionship," from fellow + -ship. In M.E. it was at times a euphemism for "sexual intercourse" (carnal fellowship).
felon	ˈfelən	late 13c., from O.Fr. felon "evil-doer, scoundrel, traitor, rebel, the Devil" (9c.), from M.L. fellonem (nom. fello) "evil-doer," of uncertain origin, perhaps from Frank. *fillo, *filljo "person who whips or beats, scourger" (cf. O.H.G. fillen "to whip"); or from L. fel "gall, poison," on the notion of "one full of bitterness." Another theory (advanced by Professor R. Atkinson of Dublin) traces it to L. fellare "to suck" (see fecund), which had an obscene secondary meaning in classical Latin (well-known to readers of Martial and Catullus), which would make a felon etymologically a "cock-sucker." OED inclines toward the "gall" explanation, but finds Atkinson's "most plausible" of the others.
felony	ˈfeləni:	late 13c. as a term in common law, in Anglo-Fr., from O.Fr. felonie (12c.) "wickedness, evil, treachery, perfidy, crime, cruelty, sin," from Gallo-Rom. *fellonia, from fellonem (see felon).
female	 ˈfi:meil	early 14c., from O.Fr. femelle (12c.) "woman, female," from M.L. femella "a female," from L. femella "young female, girl," dim. of femina "woman" (see feminine). Sense extended in V.L. from humans to female of other animals. Spelling altered late 14c. on mistaken parallel of male. As an adjective, from early 14c. Reference to sockets, etc., is from 1660s.
feminine	ˈfeminin	mid-14c., "of the female sex," from O.Fr. femenin (12c.) "feminine, female; with feminine qualities, effeminate," from L. femininus "feminine" (in the grammatical sense at first), from femina "woman, female," lit. "she who suckles," from root of felare "to suck, suckle" (see fecund). Sense of "woman-like, proper to or characteristic of women" is recorded from mid-15c. The interplay of meanings now represented in female, feminine, and effeminate, and the attempt to make them clear and separate, has led to many coinages: feminitude (1878); feminile âfeminineâ (1640s); feminility âwomanlinessâ (1838); femality (17c., âeffeminacy;â 1754 âfemale natureâ). Also feminality (1640s, âquality or state of being femaleâ), from rare adj. feminal (late 14c.), from O.Fr. feminal. And femineity âquality or state of being feminine,â from L. femineus âof a woman, pertaining to a woman.â

fencer	ˈfensə	 
fencing	ˈfensiŋ	mid-15c., âdefending, act of protecting;â 1580s in the sword-fighting sense; noun from prp. of fence (v.). In spite of the re-enactment in 1285 of the Assize of Arms of 1181, fencing was regarded as unlawful in England. The keeping of fencing schools was forbidden in the City of London, "as fools who delight in mischief do learn to fence with buckler, and thereby are encouraged in their follies." Meaning âputting up fencesâ is from 1620s; that of âan enclosureâ is from 1580s; meaning âreceiving stolen goodsâ is from 1851; meaning "materials for an enclosure" is from 1856.
fend	fend	late 13c., shortening of defend. To fend for oneself (1620s) is to see to one's own defense. Related: Fended; fending.
fender	ˈfendə	late 13c., shortening of defender. Used of attachments to boats at first, of fireplaces since 1680s; application to automobiles is 1919.

fermentation	ˌfɜ:mənˈteɪʃən	late 14c., in alchemy, with a broad sense; modern scientific sense is from c.1600; from L.L. fermentationem (nom. fermentatio), noun of action from fermentare (see ferment). Figurative use attested from 1650s.
fern	fɜ:n	O.E. fearn, from P.Gmc. *farnan (cf. O.S. farn, M.Du. vaern, Du. varen, O.H.G. farn, Ger. Farn), from PIE *porno-, a root which has yielded words for "feather, wing" (cf. Skt. parnam "feather;" Lith. papartis "fern;" Russ. paporot; Gk. pteris "fern," pteron "feather"), from root *per- (see petition). Applied to the plant perhaps from the feather-like appearance of the fronds. The plant's ability to appear as if from nothing accounts for the ancient belief that fern seeds conferred invisibility.
ferocious	fəˈrəuʃəs	1640s, from L. ferocis, oblique case of ferox "fierce, wild-looking" (see ferocity). Related: Ferociously; ferociousness.
ferocity	fəˈrɔsɪti:	c.1600, from Fr. férocité, from L. ferocitatem (nom. ferocitas) "fierceness," from ferocis, oblique case of ferox "wild, bold, courageous, warlike, fierce," lit.

fertility	fəˈtɪlɪti:	early 15c., from M.Fr. fertilité, from L. fertilitatem (nom. fertilitas) "fruitfulness, fertility," from fertilis (see fertile).
fertilize	ˈfɜ:tlˌaɪz	1660s, "a person who fertilizes," agent noun from fertilize. As a euphemism for "manure," from 1846.
fertilizer	ˈfə:tilaizə	1660s, "a person who fertilizes," agent noun from fertilize. As a euphemism for "manure," from 1846.
fervent	ˈfɜ:vənt	mid-14c., from O.Fr. fervent, from L. ferventem (nom. fervens) "boiling, hot, glowing," figuratively "violent, impetuous, furious," prp. of fervere "to boil, glow," from PIE root *bhreue- (see brew). The figurative sense of "impassioned" is first attested c.1400. Related: Fervency; fervently.

festive	ˈfestɪv	1650s, âpertaining to a feast,â from L. festivus "festive, joyous, gay," from festum âfestival, holiday,â neut. of adj. festus (see feast).  Meaning âmirthfulâ is attested by 1774. Unattested from 1651 to 1735; modern use may be a back formation from festivity. Related: Festively; festiveness.
festivity	feˈstɪvɪti:	late 14c., from O.Fr. festivité, from L. festivitatem (nom. festivitas) "good fellowship, generosity," from festivus "festive," from festum "festival or holiday," neut. of festus "of a feast" (see feast). Related: Festivities.
fetal	ˈfi:tl	1811, from fetus + -al (1). 
fetch	fetʃ	O.E. feccan, apparently a variant of fetian, fatian "to fetch, bring near, obtain; induce; to marry," probably from P.Gmc. *fatojanan (cf. O.Fris. fatia "to grasp, seize, contain," O.N. feta "to find one's way," M.Du. vatten, O.H.G. sih faggon "to mount, climb," Ger. fassen "to grasp, contain"). Variant form fet, a derivation of the older O.E. version of the word, survived as a competitor until 17c. Related: Fetched.

fete	feɪt	1754, from Fr. fête "festival, feast," from O.Fr. feste (see feast). Apparently first used in English by Horace Walpole (1717-1797). The verb is from 1819. Related: Feted; fetes; feting. 
fetid	ˈfetɪd	early 15c., from L. fetidus (commonly, but incorrectly, foetidus) "stinking," from fetere "have a bad smell, stink." Perhaps connected with fimus "dung," or with fumus "smoke."
fetish	ˈfetɪʃ	1801, "worship of fetishes;" in the purely psycho-sexual sense first recorded 1897 in writings of Henry Havelock Ellis (1859-1939), from fetish + -ism. In certain perversions of the sexual instinct, the person, part of the body, or particular object belonging to the person by whom the impulse is excited, is called the fetish of the patient. [E. Morselli in "Baldwin Dictionary of Philosophy," 1901] Related: Fetishist (1845; psycho-sexual sense from 1897).
fetter	ˈfetə	c.1300, from O.E. gefetrian (see fetter (n.)). Related: Fettered; fettering.
fettered	 	c.1300, from O.E. gefetrian (see fetter (n.)). Related: Fettered; fettering.
fetus	ˈfi:təs	late 14c., "the young while in the womb or egg," from L. fetus (often, incorrectly, foetus) "the bearing, bringing forth, or hatching of young," from Latin base *fe- "to generate, bear," also "to suck, suckle" (see fecund). In Latin, fetus sometimes was transferred figuratively to the newborn creature itself, or used in a sense of "offspring, brood" (cf. Horace's "Germania quos horrida parturit Fetus"), but this was not the basic meaning. Also used of plants, in the sense of "fruit, produce, shoot." The spelling foetus is sometimes attempted as a learned Latinism, but it is not historic.
feud	fju:d	c.1300, fede "enmity, hatred, hostility," northern English and Scottish; perhaps from an unrecorded O.E. word or else from O.Fr. fede, from O.H.G. fehida "contention, quarrel, feud," from P.Gmc. *faihitha noun of state from adj. *faiho- (cf. O.E. fæhð "enmity," fah "hostile;" Ger. Fehde "feud;" O.Fris. feithe "enmity;" see foe). Sense of "vendetta" is early 15c. Alteration of spelling in 16c. is unexplained. As a verb, from 1670s. Related: Feuded; feuding.
feudal	ˈfju:dl	a coinage of historians, first attested 1839; see feudal. Feudal system attested from 1776.
feverish	ˈfi:vərɪʃ	late 14c., "causing fever;" 1630s, âexcited; 1640s, âhaving symptoms of fever,â from fever + -ish. Earlier in same sense was feverous (late 14c.). Related: Feverishly; feverishness.
fiance	'fi:ɑ:nsei	"woman to whom one is betrothed," 1853, from Fr. fianceé, fem. of fiancé, pp. of fiancer "to betroth," from fiance "a promise, trust," from fier "to trust," from V.L. *fidare (see affiance). Has all but expelled native betrothed. The verb fiance, now obsolete, was used c.1450-1600 for "to engage to be married."
fiasco	fi:ˈæskəʊ	1855, theater slang for "a failure," by 1862 acquired the general sense of any dismal flop, on or off the stage. Via Fr. phrase fiare fiasco "turn out a failure" (19c.), from It. far fiasco "suffer a complete breakdown in performance," lit. "make a bottle," from fiasco "bottle," from L.L. flasco, flasconem (see flask). The reason for all this is utterly obscure today, but "the usual range of fanciful theories has been advanced" [Ayto]. Weekley finds it utterly mysterious and compares Fr. ramasser un pelle "to come a cropper (in bicycling), lit. to pick up a shovel." OED makes nebulous reference to "alleged incidents in Italian theatrical history." Klein suggests Venetian glass-crafters tossing aside imperfect pieces to be made later into common flasks. But according to an Italian dictionary, fare il fiasco used to mean "to play a game so that the one that loses will pay the fiasco," in other words, he will buy the next bottle (of wine). That plausibly connects the word with the notion of "a costly mistake."
fiat	ˈfi:ət	"authoritative sanction," 1630s, from L. fiat "let it be done" (also used in the opening of M.L. proclamations and commands), third person singular present subjunctive of fieri, used as passive of facere "to make, do" (see factitious). Also sometimes a reference to fiat lux "let there be light" in the Book of Genesis.
fibre	ˈfaibə	British English spelling of fiber (q.v.); for spelling, see -re.
fibrous	ˈfaibrəs	1620s, from Mod.L. fibrosus, from L. fibra (see fiber).
fickle	ˈfɪkəl	c.1200, probably from O.E. ficol "deceitful, cunning, tricky," related to befician "deceive," and to facen "deceit, treachery." Common Germanic (cf. O.S. fekan "deceit," O.H.G. feihhan "deceit, fraud, treachery"), from PIE *peig- "evil-minded, treacherous, hostile" (cf. L. piget "it irks, troubles, displeases," piger "reluctant, lazy"). Sense of "changeable" is first recorded late 13c. Related: Fickleness.
fiction	ˈfikʃən	"pertaining to fiction, 1843, from fiction + -al (1). Earlier fictitious also was used in this sense (1773).
fictitious	fɪkˈtɪʃəs	1610s, "artificial, counterfeit," from M.L. fictitus, a misspelling of L. ficticius "artificial, counterfeit," from fictus "feigned, fictitious, false," pp. of fingere (see fiction). Related: Fictitiously.
fid	fɪd	late 14c., fedele, earlier fithele, from O.E. fiðele, which is related to O.N. fiðla, M.Du. vedele, Du. vedel, O.H.G. fidula, Ger. Fiedel; all of uncertain origin, perhaps from M.L. vitula "stringed instrument," which is perhaps related to L. vitularia "celebrate joyfully," from Vitula, Roman goddess of joy and victory, who probably, like her name, originated among the Sabines [Klein, Barnhart]. Unless the Medieval Latin word is from the Germanic ones. Fiddle has been relegated to colloquial usage by its more proper cousin, violin, a process encouraged by phraseology such as fiddlesticks, contemptuous nonsense word fiddlededee (1784), and fiddle-faddle. Fit as a fiddle is from 1610s.
fidelity	fiˈdeliti	early 15c., from M.Fr. fidélité (15c.), from L. fidelitatem (nom. fidelitas) "faithfulness, adherence," from fidelis "faithful, true," from fides "faith" (see faith).
fidget	ˈfɪdʒɪt	1670s, as the fidget "uneasiness," later the fidgets, from a 16c. verb fidge "move restlessly," perhaps from M.E. fiken "to fidget, hasten," from O.N. fikjask "to desire eagerly" (cf. Ger. ficken "to move about briskly;" see fuck). The verb fidget is first attested 1670s (implied in fidgetting). Related: Fidgeted.
fidgety	 	1730s, from fidget + -y (2).
fief	fi:f	also feoff, 1610s, from Fr. fief (12c.) "possession, holding, domain," a variant of O.Fr. fieu "fee" (see fee).

fieldstone	ˈfi:ldstəun	1797, from field (n.) + stone.
fiend	fi:nd	O.E. feond "enemy, foe," originally prp. of feogan "to hate," from P.Gmc. *fijæjan (cf. O.Fris. fiand "enemy," O.S. fiond, M.D. viant, Du. vijand "enemy," O.N. fjandi, O.H.G. fiant, Goth. fijands), from PIE root *pe(i)- "to blame, revile" (cf. Goth. faian "to blame;" see passion). As spelling suggests, it was originally the opposite of friend, but the word began to be used in O.E. for "Satan" (as the "enemy of mankind"), which shifted its sense to "diabolical person" (early 13c.). The old sense of the word devolved to foe, then to the imported word enemy. For spelling with -ie- see field. Meaning "devotee (of whatever is indicated)," e.g. dope fiend, is from 1865.
fiendish	ˈfi:ndɪʃ	1520s, from fiend + -ish. Related: Fiendishly; fiendishness.
fierce	fiəs	mid-13c., "proud, noble, bold," from O.Fr. fers, nom. form of fer, fier "strong, overwhelming, violent, fierce, wild; proud, mighty, great, impressive" (Mod.Fr. fier "proud, haughty"), from L. ferus "wild, untamed," from PIE root *ghwer- "wild, wild animal" (cf. Gk. ther, O.C.S. zveri, Lith. zveris "wild beast"). Original English sense of "brave, proud" died out 16c., but caused the word at first to be commonly used as an epithet, which accounts for the rare instance of a French word entering English in the nominative case. Meaning "ferocious, wild, savage" is from c.1300. Related: Fiercely; fierceness.
fiery	ˈfaiəri	late 13c., from M.E. fier "fire" (see fire (n.)) + -y (2). The spelling is a relic of one of the attempts to render O.E. "y" in fyr in a changing system of vowel sounds. Related: Fieriness.
fig	fɪg	early 13c., from O.Fr. figue (12c.), from O.Prov. figa, from V.L. *fica, from L. ficus "fig tree, fig," from a pre-I.E. Mediterranean language, possibly Semitic (cf. Phoenician pagh "half-ripe fig"). Earlier borrowed directly into O.E. from Latin as fic. A reborrowing of a word that had been taken directly from Latin as O.E. fic. The insulting sense of the word in Shakespeare, etc. (A fig for ...) is 1570s, in part from fig as "small, valueless thing," but also from Greek and Italian use of their versions of the word as slang for "cunt," apparently because of how a ripe fig looks when split open [Rawson, Weekley]. Giving the fig (Fr. faire la figue, Sp. dar la higa) was an indecent gesture of ancient provenance, made by putting the thumb between two fingers or into the mouth, with the intended effect of the modern gesture of "flipping the bird" (see bird (3)). See sycophant. Use of fig leaf in figurative sense of "flimsy disguise" (1550s) is from Gen. iii.7.
figment	ˈfɪgmənt	early 15c., from L. figmentum "something formed or fashioned, creation," related to figura "shape" (see figure (n.)).
figurative	ˈfɪgjərətɪv	late 14c., from O.Fr. figuratif "metaphorical," from L.L. figurativus, from figurat-, pp. stem of figurare (see figure). Of speech, language, etc., "involving figures of speech," from 1845. Related: Figuratively. 
figure	ˈfiɡə	early 13c., "visible form or appearance of a person," from O.Fr. figure (10c.) "shape, body, form, figure; symbol, allegory," from L. figura "a shape, form, figure," from PIE *dheigh- "to form, build" (see dough); originally in English with meaning "numeral," but sense of "form, likeness" is almost as old (mid-13c.). Philosophical and scientific senses are from L. figura being used to translate Gk. skhema. The rhetorical use of figure dates to late 14c.; hence figure of speech (1824). Figure eight as a shape was originally figure of eight (c.1600).
figurehead	ˈfɪgjəˌhed	1765, from figure + head. Originally the ornament on the bow of a ship; sense of "leader without real authority" is first attested 1883.
figurine	ˌfɪgjəˈri:n	1854, from Fr. figurine (16c.), from It. figurina, dim. of figura, from L. figura (see figure (n.)).
filament	ˈfɪləmənt	1590s, from Mod.L. filamentum, from L.L. filare "to spin, draw out in a long line," from L. filum "thread" (see file (v.)).
filch	fɪltʃ	"steal," 1560s, slang, perhaps from c.1300 filchen "to snatch, take as booty," of unknown origin. Liberman says filch is probably from Ger. filzen "comb through." Related: Filched; filching.
file	fail	1520s, "string or wire on which documents are strung," from Fr. file "row," from M.Fr. filer (see file (v.)). The meaning "arranged collection of papers" is from 1620s; computer sense is from 1954. The military sense "line or row of men" (1590s) is from the French verb in the sense of "spin out (thread); march in file." 
filet	fɪˈleɪ	1841 in cookery, reborrowing from French of the same word that had been taken 14c. and anglicized as fillet (q.v.). Filet mignon is attested as a French word in English from 1815. The 'Chateaubriand,' the 'entrecôte,' and the 'filet mignon' (of mutton), with other forms, are all due to the more enlarged sympathies of the French butcher for what is perfect. We must entirely change the mode of cutting up the carcase before we can arrive at the same perfection in form of meat purchasable, and as that is hopeless, so is it useless to insist further on the subject on behalf of the public. ["The Kitchen and the Cellar," "Quarterly Review," April 1877] 
filial	ˈfɪli:əl	late 14c., from M.Fr. filial, from L.L. filialis "of a son or daughter," from L. filius "son," filia "daughter," possibly from a suffixed form of PIE root *bheue- "to be, exist, grow" (see be), though *dhe(i)- "to suck, suckle" (see fecund) "is more likely" [Watkins].

filibuster	ˈfɪləˌbʌstə	1580s, flibutor "pirate," probably ultimately from Du. vrijbuiter "freebooter," used of pirates in the West Indies as Sp. filibustero and Fr. flibustier, either or both of which gave the word to Amer.Eng. (see freebooter). Used 1850s and '60s of lawless adventurers from the U.S. who tried to overthrow Central American countries. The legislative sense is first recorded c.1851, probably because obstructionist legislators "pirated" debate. Not technically restricted to U.S. Senate, but that's where the strategy works best. The verb is recorded by 1853 in both the freebooting and the legislative senses. Related: Filibustered; filibustering.
filigree	ˈfɪlɪˌgri:	1690s, shortening of filigreen (1660s), from Fr. filigrane "filigree" (17c.), from It. filigrana, from L. filum "thread" (see file (v.)) + granum "grain" (see corn (1)). Related: Filigreed.
filings	ˈfailiŋz	"grit from a grinding tool," from O.E. geswearf "filings," or O.N. svarf "file dust," related to sverfa "to file."
fillet	ˈfɪlɪt	early 14c., "headband," from O.Fr. filet (12c.) "thread, filament; strip, ligament," dim. of fil "thread" (see file (v.)). Sense of "cut of meat or fish" is from late 14c., apparently so called because it was prepared by being tied up with a string.

It's possible that the original word was imitative, along the lines of flip (v.), but there seems to be some influence from flit, such as in the flirt sense of "to move in short, quick flights," attested from 1580s.  Meanwhile flirt (n.) had come to mean "a pert young hussey" [Johnson] by 1560s, and Shakespeare has flirt-gill (i.e. Jill) "a woman of light or loose behavior," while flirtgig was a 17c. Yorkshire dialect word for "a giddy, flighty girl." All or any of these could have fed into the main modern verbal sense of "play at courtship" (1777), which also could have grown naturally from the earlier meaning "to flit inconstantly from object to object" (1570s), perhaps influenced by O.Fr. fleureter "talk sweet nonsense," also "to touch a thing in passing," dim. of fleur "flower" and metaphoric of bees skimming from flower to flower.  The noun meaning "person who flirts" is from 1732. The English word also is possibly related to E.Fris. flirt "a flick or light blow," and flirtje "a giddy girl." French flirter "to flirt" is a 19c. borrowing from English. Related: Flirted; flirting.

[Chaucer, "House of Fame"] Astronomers began to speculate by mid-19c. that some of the spiral nebulae they could see in telescopes were actually immense and immensely distant structures the size and shape of the Milky Way. But the matter was not settled until the 1920s.

Or possibly gamble is from a derivative of gamel "to play games" (1590s), itself likely a frequentative from game. Originally regarded as a slang word. The intrusive -b- may be from confusion with gambol. Related: Gambled; gambling. The noun meaning "risky venture" is from 1823.

garbage	ˈɡɑ:bidʒ	early 15c., "giblets of a fowl, waste parts of an animal," later confused with garble in its sense of "siftings, refuse." Perhaps some senses derive from O.Fr. garbe "a bundle of sheaves, entrails," from P.Gmc. *garba- (cf. Du. garf, Ger. garbe "sheaf"), from PIE *ghrebh- "a handful, a grasp." Sense of "refuse, filth" is first attested 1580s; used figuratively for "worthless stuff" from 1590s. Garbology "study of waste as a social science" is from 1976.
garble	ˈgɑ:bəl	early 15c., "to inspect and remove refuse from (spices)," from Anglo-Fr. garbeler "to sift" (late 14c.), from M.L. and It. garbellare, from Arabic gharbala "to sift and select spices," related to kirbal "sieve," perhaps from L.L. cribellum, dim. of L. cribrum "sieve" (see crisis).

It. garbellare, Sp. garbillo); sense of "mix up, confuse, distort language" (by selecting some things and omitting others) first recorded 1680s. Related: Garbled; garbling.
garbled	ˈɡɑ:bld	1570s, of unknown origin; the suggestion, based on a misreading of a garbled note from Johnson, that it is from Fr. coeur mechant "evil heart" is not taken seriously; the first syllable may be cur "dog."

Berchouxâs word is from gaster + nomos âarranging, regulating.â Related: Gastronomer.
gather	ˈɡæðə	O.E. gadrian, gædrian "unite, agree, assemble; gather, collect, store up," used of flowers, thoughts, persons; from P.Gmc. *gadurojan "bring together, unite" (cf. O.E. gæd "fellowship, companionship," gædeling "companion;" M.L.G. gadderen; O.Fris. gaderia; Du. gaderen "to gather," gade "spouse;" Ger. Gatte "husband;" Goth. gadiliggs), from PIE *ghedh- "to unite, join" (see good (adj.). Change of spelling from -d- to -th- is 1500s, reflecting earlier change in pronunciation. Related: Gathered; gathering.
gauche	gəʊʃ	"awkward, tactless," 1751 (Chesterfield), from Fr. gauche "left" (15c., replacing O.Fr. senestre in that sense), originally "awkward, awry," from M.Fr. gauchir "turn aside, swerve," from O.Fr. gaucher "trample, reel, walk clumsily," from Frankish *welkan "to full," from P.Gmc. *wankjan (cf. O.H.G. wankon, O.N. vakka "to stagger, totter;" see wink).
gaucherie	ˌgəʊʃəˈri:	1798, from Fr. gaucherie, from gauche (see gauche).
gaudy	ˈgɔ:di:	"showy, tastelessly rich," 1580s, probably ultimately from M.E. gaudi "large, ornamental bead in a rosary" (early 14c.); but there is a parallel sense of gaudy as "full of trickery" (1520s), from M.E. gaud "deception, trick," from gaudi "a jest, trick," possibly from Anglo-Fr. gaudir "be merry, scoff," from L. gaudere "rejoice" (see joy). Alternative etymology of the adjective is from M.E. gaudegrene "yellowish-green" (early 14c.), originally "green dye" obtained from a plant formerly known as weld, from a Germanic source (see weld (n.)), which became gaude in Old French. The English term supposedly shifted sense from "weld-dye" to "bright." As a noun, "feast, festival" 1650s, from gaudy day "day of rejoicing" (1560s).
gauge	ɡeidʒ	"ascertain by exact measurements," mid-15c., from Anglo-Fr. gauge (mid-14c.), from O.N.Fr. gauger (O.Fr. jauger), from gauge "gauging rod," perhaps from Frankish *galgo "rod, pole for measuring" (cf. O.N. gelgja "pole, perch," O.H.G. galgo; see gallows). Related: Gauged; gauging. The figurative use is from 1580s. As a noun, "fixed standard of measure," early 15c. (surname Gageman is early 14c.), from O.N.Fr. gauge "gauging rod." Meaning "instrument for measuring" is from 1680s.
gaunt	gɔ:nt	mid-15c. (as a surname from mid-13c.), from M.Fr. gant, of uncertain origin; perhaps from a Scandinavian source (cf. O.N. gand "a thin stick," also "a tall thin man") and somehow connected with the root of gander. Connection also has been suggested to O.Fr. jaunet "yellowish" [Middle English Dictionary].
gauze	gɔ:z	1560s, gais, from Fr. gaze, conjectured to be from Arabic gazz "raw silk" [Barnhart], or from Gaza, Palestinian city associated with production of this fabric [Klein, Du Cagne].
gavel	ˈgævəl	"small mallet used by presiding officers at meetings," 1805, Amer.Eng., of unknown origin; perhaps connected with Ger. dial. gaffel "brotherhood, friendly society," from M.H.G. gaffel "society, guild," related to O.E. gafol "tribute," giefan "to give" (see habit). But in some sources gavel also is identified as a type of mason's tool, in which case the extended meaning may be via freemasonry. As a verb, by 1887, from the noun.
gawk	ɡɔ:k	1785, Amer.Eng., perhaps from gaw, a survival from M.E. gowen "to stare" (c.1200), from a Scandinavian source akin to O.N. ga "to heed," from P.Gmc. *gawon-, from PIE *ghow-e- "to honor, revere, worship" (see favor (n.)); and altered perhaps by gawk hand (see gawky). Liberman writes that it "need not have been derived from gowk. It is possibly another independent onomatopoeic formation with the structure g-k. Related: Gawked; gawking.
gawky	ˈɡɔ:ki	"awkward, ungainly," 1724, from gawk hand "left hand" (1703), perhaps a contraction of gaulick, thus "gaulish hand," derogatory slang that could have originated during some period of strained Anglo-French relations, i.e. most of recorded history.
gay	ɡei	late 14c., "full of joy, merry; light-hearted, carefree;" also "wanton, lewd, lascivious" (late 12c. as a surname, Philippus de Gay), from O.Fr. gai "joyful, happy; pleasant, agreeably charming; forward, pert" (12c.; cf. O.Sp. gayo, Port. gaio, It. gajo, probably French loan-words). Ultimate origin disputed; perhaps from Frankish *gahi (cf. O.H.G. wahi "pretty"), though not all etymologists accept this. Meaning "stately and beautiful; splendid and showily dressed" is from early 14c. The word gay by the 1890s had an overall tinge of promiscuity -- a gay house was a brothel. The suggestion of immorality in the word can be traced back at least to the 1630s, if not to Chaucer:  But in oure bed he was so fressh and gay Whan that he wolde han my bele chose.  Slang meaning "homosexual" (adj.) begins to appear in psychological writing late 1940s, evidently picked up from gay slang and not always easily distinguished from the older sense:  After discharge A.Z. lived for some time at home. He was not happy at the farm and went to a Western city where he associated with a homosexual crowd, being "gay," and wearing female clothes and makeup. He always wished others would make advances to him. ["Rorschach Research Exchange and Journal of Projective Techniques," 1947, p.240]  The association with (male) homosexuality likely got a boost from the term gay cat, used as far back as 1893 in Amer.Eng. for "young hobo," one who is new on the road, also one who sometimes does jobs.  "A Gay Cat," said he, "is a loafing laborer, who works maybe a week, gets his wages and vagabonds about hunting for another 'pick and shovel' job. Do you want to know where they got their monica (nickname) 'Gay Cat'? See, Kid, cats sneak about and scratch immediately after chumming with you and then get gay (fresh). That's why we call them 'Gay Cats'." [Leon Ray Livingston ("America's Most Celebrated Tramp"), "Life and Adventures of A-no. 1," 1910]  Quoting a tramp named Frenchy, who might not have known the origin. Gay cats were severely and cruelly abused by "real" tramps and bums, who considered them "an inferior order of beings who begs of and otherwise preys upon the bum -- as it were a jackal following up the king of beasts" [Prof. John J. McCook, "Tramps," in "The Public Treatment of Pauperism," 1893], but some accounts report certain older tramps would dominate a gay cat and employ him as a sort of slave. In "Sociology and Social Research" (1932-33) a paragraph on the "gay cat" phenomenon notes, "Homosexual practices are more common than rare in this group," and gey cat "homosexual boy" is attested in N. Erskine's 1933 dictionary of "Underworld & Prison Slang" (gey is a Scottish variant of gay).  The "Dictionary of American Slang" reports that gay (adj.) was used by homosexuals, among themselves, in this sense since at least 1920. Rawson ["Wicked Words"] notes a male prostitute using gay in reference to male homosexuals (but also to female prostitutes) in London's notorious Cleveland Street Scandal of 1889. Ayto ["20th Century Words"] calls attention to the ambiguous use of the word in the 1868 song "The Gay Young Clerk in the Dry Goods Store," by U.S. female impersonator Will S. Hays, but the word evidently was not popularly felt in this sense by wider society until the 1950s at the earliest.  "Gay" (or "gai") is now widely used in French, Dutch, Danish, Japanese, Swedish, and Catalan with the same sense as the English. It is coming into use in Germany and among the English-speaking upper classes of many cosmopolitan areas in other countries. [John Boswell, "Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality," 1980]  Gay as a noun meaning "a (usually male) homosexual" is attested from 1971; in M.E. it meant "excellent person, noble lady, gallant knight," also "something gay or bright; an ornament or badge" (c.1400).
gaze	ɡeiz	1752, supposedly a facetious formation from gaze + -bo, Latin first person singular future tense suffix (cf. videbo "I shall see"), on model of earlier belvedere "cupola," from It. bello verde "handsome sight." But perhaps rather a corruption of some oriental word.
gazette	ɡəˈzet	âto announce in the Gazette,â 1670s; see gazette. The three official journals were published in Britain from c.1665, twice weekly, and contained lists of appointments, promotions, public notices, etc. Hence, âto be gazetted;â to be named to a command, etc.
gazetteer	ˌgæzɪˈtɪə	1610s, âjournalist,â from gazette (n.) + -eer. Meaning âgeographical dictionaryâ is from 1704, from Laurence Eachard's 1693 geographical handbook for journalists, "The Gazetteer's, or Newsman's, Interpreter," second edition simply titled "The Gazetteer."

gelatinous	dʒəˈlætnəs	1724, from gelatin + -ous; probably modeled on Fr. gélatineux. Related: Gelatinously; gelatinousness.
gem	dʒem	O.E. gimm "precious stone, gem, jewel," also "eye," from L. gemma "precious stone, jewel," originally "bud," perhaps from the root *gen- "to produce," or from PIE *gembh- "tooth, nail." Of persons, from late 13c. Forms in -i-, -y- were lost early 14c., and the modern form of the word probably representing a M.E. borrowing from O.Fr. gemme (12c.). As a verb, from c.1600, "to adorn with gems;" mid-12c. as "to bud."
gender	ˈdʒendə	c.1300, "kind, sort, class," from O.Fr. gendre (12c., Mod.Fr. genre), from stem of L. genus (gen. generis) "race, stock, family; kind, rank, order; species," also (male or female) "sex" (see genus) and used to translate Aristotle's Greek grammatical term genos. The grammatical sense is attested in English from late 14c.; the male-or-female sense from early 15c. As sex took on erotic qualities in 20c., gender came to be the common word used for "sex of a human being," often in feminist writing with reference to social attributes as much as biological qualities; this sense first attested 1963. Gender-bender is first attested 1980, with reference to pop star David Bowie.
gene	dʒi:n	1911, from Ger. Gen, coined 1905 by Danish scientist Wilhelm Ludvig Johannsen (1857-1927), from Gk. genea "generation, race" (see genus). De Vries had earlier called them pangenes. Gene pool is attested from 1950.

glowing	ˈgləʊɪŋ	c.1500, "resplendent," from L. flagrantem (nom. flagrans) "burning, blazing, glowing," figuratively "glowing with passion, eager, vehement," prp. of flagrare "to burn, blaze, glow" from L. root *flag-, corresponding to PIE *bhleg- "to shine, flash, burn" (cf.

gnarled	nɑ:ld	the source of the group of words that includes gnarl (v.), gnarl (n.), gnarly is Shakespeare's use of gnarled in 1603:  Thy sharpe and sulpherous bolt Splits the vn-wedgable and gnarled Oke. ["Measure for Measure," II.ii.116]  OED and Barnhart call it a variant of knurled, from M.E. knar "knot in wood" (late 14c.), originally "a rock, a stone;" of uncertain origin. "(Gnarled) occurs in one passage of Shakes. (for which the sole authority is the folio of 1623), whence it came into general use in the nineteenth century" [OED].
gnat	næt	O.E. gnætt "gnat, midge, mosquito," earlier gneat, used of various small, flying insects, from P.Gmc. *gnattaz (cf. Low Ger. gnatte, Ger. Gnitze); perhaps lit. "biting insect" and related to gnaw.  The gnatte is a litil fflye, and hatte culex..he soukeþ blood and haþ in his mouþ a pipe, as hit were a pricke..And is a-countid a-mong volatiles..and greueþ slepinge men wiþ noyse & wiþ bytinge and wakeþ hem of here reste. [John of Trevisa, transl. of Bartholomew de Glanville's "De proprietatibus rerum," 1398]

gneiss	naɪs	1757, from Ger. Gneiss "type of metamorphic rock," probably from M.H.G. gneist "spark" (so called because the rock glitters), from O.H.G. gneisto "spark" (cf. O.E. gnast "spark," O.N. gneisti).
gnome	nəʊm	"dwarf-like earth-dwelling spirit," 1712, from Fr. gnome, from Mod.L. gnomus, used 16c. in a treatise by Paracelsus, who gave the name pigmaei or gnomi to elemental earth beings, possibly from Gk. *genomos "earth-dweller" (cf. thalassonomos "inhabitant of the sea"). A less-likely suggestion is that Paracelsus based it on the homonym that means "intelligence" (preserved in gnomic). Popular in children's literature 19c. as a name for red-capped German and Swiss folklore dwarfs. Garden figurines first imported to England late 1860s from Germany.
gnomic	ˈnəʊmɪk	"full of instructive sayings," 1815, from Fr. gnomique (18c.) and directly from L.L. gnomicus "concerned with maxims, didactic," from Gk. gnomikos, from gnome "thought, opinion, maxim, intelligence," from root of gignoskein "to come to know" (see gnostic). English gnome meant "short, pithy statement of general truth" (1570s). Gnomical is attested from 1610s.

go	ɡəu	O.E. gan "to go, advance, depart; happen; conquer; observe," from W.Gmc. *gai-/*gæ- (cf. O.S., O.Fris. gan, M.Du. gaen, Du. gaan, O.H.G. gan, Ger. gehen), from PIE *ghe- "to release, let go" (cf. Skt. jihite "goes away," Gk. kikhano "I reach, meet with"), but there is not general agreement on cognates.  The O.E. past tense was eode, of uncertain origin but evidently once a different word (perhaps connected to Goth. iddja); it was replaced 1400s by went, formerly past tense of wenden "to direct one's way" (see wend). In northern England and Scotland, however, eode tended to be replaced by gaed, a construction based on go. In modern English, only be and go take their past tenses from entirely different verbs.  The word in its various forms and combinations takes up 45 columns of close print in the OED. Verbal meaning "say" emerged 1960s in teen slang. Colloquial meaning "urinate or defecate" attested by 1926. Go for broke is from 1951, Amer.Eng. colloquial; go down on "perform oral sex on" is from 1916. That goes without saying (1878) translates Fr. cela va sans dire. As an adjective, "in order," from 1951, originally in aerospace jargon.
goad	gəʊd	O.E. gad "point, spearhead, arrowhead," from P.Gmc. *gaido (cf. Lombardic gaida "spear"), from PIE *ghei- (cf. Skt. hetih "missile, projectile," himsati "he injures;" Avestan zaena- "weapon;" Gk. khaios "shepherd's staff;" O.E. gar "spear;" O.Ir. gae "spear"). Figurative use is since 16c., probably from the Bible. The verb is from 1570s, from the noun; earliest use is figurative. Related: Goaded; goading.
goal	ɡəul	1921, from goal + -ie. Probably a shortening of goal-tender (1909), which tends to be the term used in ice hockey, as opposed to goal-keeper (1650s).
gobble	ˈgɔbəl	"make a turkey noise," 1670s, probably imitative, perhaps influenced by gobble (1) or gargle. As a noun from 1781.
goblet	ˈgɔblɪt	late 14c., from O.Fr. gobelet "goblet, cup," dim. of gobel "cup," probably related to gobe "gulp down" (see gob).
goggle	ˈɡɔɡl	1530s, from M.E. gogelen "to roll (the eyes) about" (late 14c.), influenced by M.E. gogel-eyed "squint-eyed, one-eyed" (late 14c.), of uncertain origin, perhaps somehow imitative. As a surname (Robert le Gogel) attested from c.1300. Related: Goggled; goggling. As a noun, 1650s, "goggling look;" earlier "person who goggles" (1610s). Goggle-eyed (adj.) is from late 14c.

good	ɡud	O.E. gōd "that which is good, goodness; advantage, benefit; gift; virtue; property;" from good (adj.).
goods	ɡudz	"property," late 13c., from plural of good (n.), which had the same sense in Old English. Meaning âsaleable commoditiesâ is mid-15c.; colloquial sense of âstolen articlesâ is from 1900; hence figurative use, âevidence of guilt.â
goodwill	ˈgʊdˈwɪl	O.E. godes willan âvirtuous, pious, upright,â also âstate of wishing well to another.â One-word form goodwill (18c.) is used especially in commercial senses.
goof	ɡu:f	"narcotic," 1938, from goof + ball (1); as an intensive of goof (n.), it dates from 1959.
gore	gɔ:	c.1400, from Scottish gorren "to pierce, stab," origin unknown, perhaps related to O.E. gar "spear" (see gar, also gore (n.2) "triangular piece of ground"). Related: Gored; goring.
gorge	gɔ:dʒ	"eat greedily," c.1300, from O.Fr. gorger, from gorge (see gorge (n.)). Related: Gorged; gorging.

gorgon	ˈgɔ:gən	late 14c., any of the three hideous sisters in Greek legend, whose look turned beholders to stone (Madusa was one of them), from Gk. Gorgo (pl. Gorgones), from gorgos "terrible," of unknown origin. Transferred sense of "terrifyingly ugly person" is from 1520s.
gorilla	ɡəˈrilə	1847, applied to the apes (Troglodytes gorills) by U.S. missionary Thomas Savage, from Gk. gorillai, plural of name given to wild, hairy people in a Greek translation of Carthaginian navigator Hanno's account of his voyage along the N.W. coast of Africa, c.500 B.C.E. Allegedly an African word.  In its inmost recess was an island similar to that formerly described, which contained in like manner a lake with another island, inhabited by a rude description of people. The females were much more numerous than the males, and had rough skins: our interpreters called them Gorillae. We pursued but could take none of the males; they all escaped to the top of precipices, which they mounted with ease, and threw down stones; we took three of the females, but they made such violent struggles, biting and tearing their captors, that we killed them, and stripped off the skins, which we carried to Carthage: being out of provisions we could go no further. [Hanno, "Periplus"]  Of persons perceived as being gorilla-like, from 1884.
gormandize	ˈgɔ:mənˌdaɪz	1540s, from gourmand + -ize.
gory	ˈgɔ:ri:	"blood-soaked," late 15c., from gore (n.) + -y (2).
gosling	ˈgɔzlɪŋ	mid-14c. (late 13c. as a surname), from O.N. gæslingr, from gos "goose" (see goose) + dim. suffix. replaced O.E. gesling. The modern word may be a M.E. formation from M.E. gos "goose."
gospel	ˈɡɔspəl	O.E. godspel "gospel, glad tidings announced by Jesus; one of the four gospels," from god "good" (see good) + spel "story, message" (see spell (n.)); translation of L. bona adnuntiatio, itself a translation of Gk. euangelion "reward for bringing good news."  The first element of the O.E. word had a long "o," but it shifted under mistaken association with God. The word passed early from English to continental Germanic languages in forms that clearly indicate the first element had shifted to "God," e.g. O.S. godspell, O.H.G. gotspell, O.N. goðspiall. Used of anything as true as the Gospel from mid-13c. Gospel-gossip was Addison's word ("Spectator," 1711) for "one who is always talking of sermons, texts, etc."
gossamer	ˈgɔsəmə	c.1300, "spider threads spun in fields of stubble in late fall," apparently from gos "goose" + sumer "summer" (cf. Swed. sommertrad "summer thread"). The reference might be to a fancied resemblance of the silk to goose down, or because geese are in season then. The German equivalent mädchensommer (lit. "girls' summer") also has a sense of "Indian summer," and the English word originally may have referred to a warm spell in autumn before being transferred to a phenomenon especially noticable then. Cf. obsolete Scottish go-summer "period of summer-like weather in late autumn." Meaning "anything light or flimsy" is from c.1400. The adjective sense "filmy" is attested from 1802.
gossip	ˈɡɔsip	1818, from gossip + -y (2).
gouge	gaʊdʒ	1560s, "to cut with a gouge," from gouge (n.). Meaning "to force out with a gouge" (especially of the eyes, in fighting) attested by 1800. Meaning "swindle" is Amer.Eng. colloquial from 1826 (implied in plural noun gougers). Related: Gouged; gouging.
gourd	gɔ:d	c.1300, from Anglo-Fr. gourde, from O.Fr. coorde, ultimately from L. cucurbita "gourd," of uncertain origin, perhaps related to cucumis "cucumber."
gourmand	gʊəˈmɑ:nd	late 15c., "glutton," from M.Fr. gourmant "glutton," originally an adj., "gluttonous," of uncertain origin. Not connected with gourmet. Meaning "one fond of good eating" is from 1758.  The gourmand is one whose chief pleasure is eating; but a gourmet is a connoisseur of food and wines. In England the difference is this: a gourmand regards quantity more than quality, a gourmet quality more than quantity. [Brewer, "Dictionary of Phrase and Fable," Philadelphia, 1898] 
gourmet	gʊəˈmeɪ	"connoisseur in eating and drinking," 1820, from Fr. gourmet, altered (by influence of M.Fr. gourmant "glutton") from O.Fr. groume, originally "wine-taster, wine merchant's servant" (in 13c. "a lad generally"), of uncertain origin. As an adjective from 1900. Cf. gourmand.
govern	ˈɡʌvən	late 13c., from O.Fr. governer (11c., Mod.Fr. gouverner) "govern," from L. gubernare "to direct, rule, guide, govern" (cf. Sp. gobernar, It. governare), originally "to steer," a nautical borrowing from Gk. kybernan "to steer or pilot a ship, direct" (the root of cybernetics). The -k- to -g- sound shift is perhaps via the medium of Etruscan. Related: Governed; governing.
governance	ˈgʌvənəns	late 14c., "act or manner of governing," from O.Fr. gouvernance "government, rule, administration; (rule of) conduct," from governer (see govern). Fowler writes that the word "has now the dignity of incipient archaism," but it might continue useful in its original sense as government comes primarily to mean "the governing power in a state."

gown	ɡaun	c.1300, from O.Fr. goune "robe, coat, habit, gown," from L.L. gunna "leather garment, skin, hide," of unknown origin. Used by St. Boniface (8c.) for a fur garment permitted for old or infirm monks. Klein writes it is probably "a word adopted from a language of the Apennine or the Balkan Peninsula." OED points to Byzantine Gk. gouna, a word for a coarse garment sometimes made of skins, but also notes "some scholars regard [L.L. gunna] as of Celtic origin."  In 18c., gown was the common word for what is now usually styled a dress. It was maintained more in Amer.Eng. than in Britain, but was somewhat revived 20c. in fashion senses and in comb. forms (e.g. bridal gown, nightgown). Meaning "flowing robe worn as a badge of office or authority" is from late 14c., on image of the Roman toga. As collective singular for "residents of a university" (1650s) it is now usually opposed to town.
grab	ɡræb	1580s, from M.Du. or M.L.G. grabben "to grab," from P.Gmc. *grab (cf. O.E. græppian "to seize," O.S. garva, O.H.G. garba "sheaf," lit. "that which is gathered up together"), from PIE *ghrebh- "to seize, reach" (cf. Skt. grbhnati "seizes," O.Pers. grab- "seize" as possession or prisoner, O.C.S. grabiti "to seize, rob," Lith. grebiu "to rake"). Sense of "to get by unscrupulous methods" reinforced by grab game, a kind of swindle, attested from 1846. Related: Grabbed; grabbing.
grace	ɡreis	c.1200, "to thank," from O.Fr. gracier, from grace (see grace (n.)). Meaning "to show favor" (mid-15c.) led to that of "to lend or add grace to something" (1580s, e.g. grace us with your presence), which is the root of the musical sense in grace notes (1650s). Related: Graced; gracing.
gracile	ˈɡræsail	1620s, from L. gracilis âslender, thin, fine; plain, simple.â Not etymologically connected to grace but often regarded as if it is. Perhaps a dissimilated form related to L. cracens "slender;" if so, perhaps cognate with Skt. krsah "thin, weak," Avestan keresa- "lean, meager," Lith. karštu "to be very old, to age."
gracious	ˈɡreiʃəs	c.1300, "filled with God's grace," from O.Fr. gracios "courteous, pleasing, kind, friendly" (12c., Mod.Fr. gracieux), from L. gratiosus "enjoying favor, agreeable, obliging; popular, acceptable," from gratia (see grace).

Lith. gridiju "to go, wander," O.C.S. gredo "to come," O.Ir. in-greinn "he pursues," and second element in congress, progress, etc.). Replaced M.E. gree "step, degree in a series," from O.Fr. grei "step," from L. gradus. Railway sense is from 1811. Meaning "class of things having the same quality or value" is from 1807; meaning "division of a school curriculum equivalent to one year" is from 1835; that of "letter-mark indicating assessment of a student's work" is from 1886 (earlier used of numerical grades). Grade A "top quality, fit for human consumption" (originally of milk) is from a U.S. system instituted in 1912.
gradient	ˈgreɪdi:ənt	"steep slope of a road or railroad," 1835, principally in Amer.Eng., from grade (n.) by analogy of quotient, etc. It was used 17c. as an adjective, of animals, "characterized by walking;" in that case probably from L. gradientem, prp. of gradi "to walk."
gradual	ˈɡrædjuəl	early 15c., "having steps or ridges," from M.L. gradualis, from L. gradus "step" (see grade). Meaning "arranged by degrees" is from 1540s; that of "taking place by degrees" is from 1690s.

graft	ɡrɑ:ft	"corruption," 1865, perhaps 1859, Amer.Eng., perhaps from graft (1) via British slang sense of "one's occupation" (1853), which seems to be from the word's original sense of "digging" (see graft (1)).
grain	ɡrein	early 13c., "scarlet dye made from insects" (late 12c. in surnames), from O.Fr. grain (12c.) "seed, grain, particle, berry, scarlet dye" (see cochineal for last sense), from L. granum "seed, a grain, small kernel" (see corn (1)). As a collective singular meaning "seed of wheat and allied grasses used as food," it is attested from early 14c. Extended from c.1300 to other objects (e.g. salt, sand). As a unit of weight, from 1540s. Used of wood (1560s), from the arrangement of fibers, which resemble seeds. Hence, against the grain (1650), a metaphor from carpentry: cutting across the fibers of the wood is more difficult than cutting along them.
granary	ˈgrænəri:	1560s, from L. granaria "granary, store house for corn," from granum "grain" (see corn (1)).
grand	ɡrænd	"convulsive epilepsy" (with loss of consciousness), 1842, from Fr. grand mal, lit. "great sickness" (see grand (adj.)). Opposed to petit mal "absence seizure."

grandiosity	ˌgrændɪˈɔsɪtɪ	1814, from Fr. grandiose (see grandiose) + -ity.  The author now and then makes a word for his own use, as complicate, for complicated; and, still less fortunately 'grandiosity' (p. 343). [review of Joseph Forsyth's "Remarks on Italy," "Edinburgh Review," January 1814] 
grandstand	ˈgrændˌstænd	"main seating for spectators at an outdoor event," 1834, from grand (adj.)+ stand. The verb meaning "to show off" is student slang from 1895, from grandstand player, attested in baseball slang from 1888.It's little things of this sort which makes the 'grand stand player.' They make impossible catches, and when they get the ball they roll all over the field. [M.J. Kelly, "Play Ball," 1888] Cf.

guideline	ˈɡaidlain	1785, âline marked on a surface before cutting,â from guide + line. Meaning ârope for steering a hot-air balloonâ is from 1846. In figurative use by 1948. Related: Guidelines.
guild	ɡild	early 13c., yilde (spelling later influenced by O.N. gildi "guild, brotherhood"), a semantic fusion of O.E. gegyld "guild" and gild, gyld "payment, tribute, compensation," from P.Gmc. *gelth- "pay" (cf. O.Fris. geld "money," O.S. geld "payment, sacrifice, reward," O.H.G. gelt "payment, tribute;" see yield (v.)).  The connecting sense is of a tribute or payment to join a protective or trade society. But some see the root in its alternative sense of "sacrifice," as if in worship, and see the word as meaning a combination for religious purposes, either Christian or pagan. The Anglo-Saxon guilds had a strong religious component; they were burial societies that paid for masses for the souls of deceased members as well as paying fines in cases of justified crime. The continental custom of guilds of merchants arrived after the Conquest, with incorporated societies of merchants in each town or city holding exclusive rights of doing business there. In many cases they became the governing body of a town (cf. Guildhall, which came to be the London city hall). Trade guilds arose 14c., as craftsmen united to protect their common interest.
guile	gaɪl	mid-12c., from O.Fr. guile "deceit, wile, fraud, ruse, trickery," from Frankish *wigila "trick, ruse" or a related Germanic source (cf. O.Fris. wigila "sorcery, witchcraft," O.E. wil "trick;" see wile).

guillotine	ˈgɪləˌti:n	"The name of the machine in which the axe descends in grooves from a considerable height so that the stroke is certain and the head instantly severed from the body." ["Universal Magazine of Knowledge and Pleasure," January 1793], 1791, from Fr. guillotine, named in recognition of French physician Joseph Guillotin (1738-1814), who as deputy to the National Assembly (1789) proposed, for humanitarian and efficiency reasons, that capital punishment be carried out by beheading quickly and cleanly on a machine, which was built in 1791 and first used the next year. The verb is first attested 1794. Related: Guillotined; guillotining. 
guilt	gɪlt	O.E. gylt "crime, sin, fault, fine," of unknown origin, though some suspect a connection to O.E. gieldan "to pay for, debt," but OED editors find this "inadmissible phonologically." The mistaken use for "sense of guilt" is first recorded 1680s. Guilt by association recorded by 1919. Old English had a verbal form, gyltan "to commit an offense;" the modern verbal meaning "to influence someone by appealing to his sense of guiltiness" is attested from 1995 and is probably directly from the noun. Related: Guilted; guilting.
guilty	ˈɡilti	O.E. gyltig, from gylt (see guilt). Of conscience, feelings, etc., 1590s. Meaning "person who is guilty" is from 1540s.

gulch	gʌltʃ	"deep ravine," 1832, Amer.Eng., perhaps from obsolete or dialectal verb gulsh "sink in" (of land), "gush out" (of water), from M.E. gulchen "to gush forth; to drink greedily" (c.1200). Cf. gulche-cuppe "a greedy drinker" (mid-13c.).
gull	gʌl	cant term for "dupe, sucker, credulous person," 1590s, of uncertain origin. Perhaps from verb meaning "to dupe, cheat" (1540s), earlier "to swallow" (1520s), ultimately from gull "throat, gullet" (early 15c.); see gullet. Or it is perhaps from (or influenced by) the bird (see gull (1)); in either case with a sense of "someone who will swallow anything thrown at him." Another possibility is M.E. dial. gull "newly hatched bird" (late 14c.), which is perhaps from O.N. golr "yellow," from the hue of its down.   
gullible	ˈgʌləbəl	1825, apparently a back formation from gullibility. Gullable is attested from 1818.
gully	ˈgʌli:	"channel made by running water," 1650s, possibly a variant of M.E. golet "water channel" (see gullet). Gully-washer, Amer.Eng. colloquial for "heavy rainstorm," attested by 1887.

gumption	ˈgʌmpʃən	1719, originally Scottish, "common sense, shrewdness," also "drive, initiative," possibly connected with M.E. gome "attention, heed," from O.N. gaumr "heed, attention." Sense of "initiative" is first recorded 1812.
guru	ˈɡuru:	1800, gooroo, from Hindi guru "teacher, priest," from Skt. guru-s "one to be honored, teacher," lit. "heavy, weighty," from PIE root *gru- (see grave (adj.)). Generalized sense of "mentor" is from 1940; sense of "expert in something" first recorded c.1966 in Canadian English in reference to Marshall McLuhan.
gush	ɡʌʃ	12c., gosshien "make noises in the stomach," later (c.1400) "rush out suddenly, pour out," probably formed onomatopoeically in English under influence of O.N. gusa "to gush, spurt," related to geyser.

gusto	ˈgʌstəʊ	1620s, from It. gusto "taste," from L. gustus "a tasting," related to gustare "to taste, take a little of," from PIE root *geus- "to taste, choose" (cf. Skt. jus- "enjoy, be pleased," Avestan zaosa- "pleasure," O.Pers. dauš- "enjoy"), a root that forms words for "taste" in Greek and Latin, but mostly meaning "try" or "choose" in Germanic and Celtic (cf. O.E. cosan, cesan "to choose," Goth. kausjan "to test, to taste of," O.H.G. koston "try," Ger. kosten "taste of"). The semantic development could have been in either direction. In English, guste "organ of taste, sense of taste," is mid-15c., from French.
gusty	ˈɡʌsti	c.1600, from gust + -y (2). Related: Gustily; gustiness.
gutless	ˈgʌtlɪs	"cowardly," 1900, from gut (n.) in the figurative "spirit" sense (see guts) + -less. Literal sense is from c.1600. Related: Gutlessly.

gymnast	ˈdʒɪmˌnæst	1590s in the modern sense, a back formation from gymnastic. Greek gymnastes was "a trainer of professional athletes."
gynaecocracy	ˌdʒaɪnɪˈkɔkrəsɪ	government by women or a woman, 1570s, from Gk. gyne (see queen) + -arkhe (see archon). Gynaecocracy and gyneocracy attested from 1610s.

O.Fris. hackia "to chop or hack," Du. hakken, O.H.G. hacchon, Ger. hacken), from PIE *keg- "hook, tooth." Perhaps influenced by O.N. höggva "to hack, hew" (cf. hacksaw). Slang sense of "cope with" (such as in can't hack it) is first recorded in Amer.Eng. 1955, with a sense of "get through by some effort," as a jungle (cf. phrase hack after "keep working away at" attested from late 14c.). Related: Hacked; hacking.
hackles	ˈhæklz	O.E. hacele "cloak, mantle" (cf. O.H.G. hachul, Goth. hakuls "cloak;" O.N. hekla "hooded frock").

Haft "arrest"), from PIE *kap- "to grasp" (see capable). To haven other haeftes in hand "have other hafts in hand" was a 14c.-15c. way of saying "have other business to attend to."
haggard	ˈhægəd	1560s, "wild, unruly" (originally in reference to hawks), from M.Fr. haggard, probably from O.Fr. faulcon hagard "wild falcon," lit. "falcon of the woods," from M.H.G. hag "hedge, copse, wood," from P.Gmc. *hagon-, from PIE root *kagh- "to catch, seize;" also "wickerwork, fence" (see hedge). OED, however, finds this whole derivation "very doubtful." Sense perhaps reinforced by Low Ger. hager "gaunt, haggard." Sense of "with a haunted expression" first recorded 1690s, that of "careworn" first recorded 1853. Sense influenced by association with hag (q.v.). Related: Haggardly.

hairy	ˈheəri:	early 14c., from hair + -y (2). From 1848 in slang sense of "difficult." Farmer calls this "Oxford slang." Perhaps from the notion of "rugged, rough." Related: Hairiness.
halcyon	ˈhælsi:ən	1540s, in halcyon dayes (L. alcyonei dies, Gk. alkyonides hemerai), 14 days of calm weather at the winter solstice, when a mythical bird (identified with the kingfisher) was said to breed in a nest floating on calm seas. From halcyon (n.), late 14c., from L. halcyon, from Gk. halkyon, variant (perhaps a misspelling) of alkyon "kingfisher," from hals "sea, salt" (see halo-) + kyon "conceiving," prp. of kyein "to conceive," lit. "to swell," from PIE root *keue- "to swell." Identified in mythology with Halcyone, daughter of Aeolus, who when widowed threw herself into the sea and became a kingfisher.
hale	heil	"healthy," O.E. hal "healthy, entire, uninjured" (see health). The Scottish and northern English form of whole; it was given a literary sense of "free from infirmity" (1734). Related: Haleness.
half-backed	 	c.1300, "one at dice," from O.Fr. as "one at dice," from L. as "a unit, one, a whole, unity;" also the name of a small Roman coin ("originally one pound of copper; reduced by depreciation to half an ounce" [Lewis]), perhaps originally Etruscan and related to Greek eis "one" (from PIE *sem- "one, as one"), or directly from the Greek word.  In English, it meant the side of the die with only one mark before it meant the playing card with one pip (1530s). Because this was the lowest roll at dice, ace was used metaphorically in Middle English for "bad luck" or "something of no value;" but as the ace is often the highest playing card, the extended senses based on "excellence, good quality" arose 18c. as card-playing became popular. Ace in the hole in the figurative sense of "concealed advantage" is attested from 1904, from crooked stud poker deals.  Meaning "outstanding pilot" dates from 1917 (technically, in WWI aviators' jargon, one who has brought down 10 enemy planes, though originally in reference to 5 shot down), from Fr. l'ace (1915), which, according to Bruce Robertson (ed.) "Air Aces of the 1914-1918 War" was used in prewar French sporting publications for "top of the deck" boxers, cyclists, etc. Sports meaning of "point scored" (1819) led to that of "unreturnable serve" (1889).
halfhearted	ˈhɑ:fˈhɑ:tɪd	also halfhearted, early 15c.; see half + hearted. Related: halfheartedly; halfheartedness. English in 17c. also had half-headed "stupid."
halibut	ˈhæləbət	large flatfish, early 15c., perhaps from hali "holy" (see holy) + butte "flatfish;" supposedly so called from its being eaten on holy days (cf. cognate Du. heilbot, Low Ger. heilbutt, Swed. helgeflundra, Dan. helleflynder). The second element is a general Germanic name applied to various kinds of flat fishes; cf. O.Swed. but "flatfish," M.E. butt (c.1300), perhaps ultimately from PIE *bhauh- "to strike."
hallmark	ˈhɔ:lˌmɑ:k	1721, official stamp of purity in gold and silver articles, from Goldsmiths' Hall in London, site of the assay office; see hall + mark (n.1). General sense of "mark of quality" first recorded 1864. As a verb from 1773.
hallow	ˈhæləʊ	in All-Hallows, a survival of hallow in the noun sense of âholy personage, saint,â attested from O.E. haligra but little used after c.1500. Hallowmas "All-saints" is first attested late 14c.
hallowed	ˈhæləʊd	"pertaining to sacred things," 1650s (implied in hieratical), from L. hieraticus, from Gk. hieratikos "pertaining to a priest or his office, priestly," from hierateia "priesthood," from hiereus "priest," from hieros "sacred, holy, hallowed; superhuman, mighty; divine" (see ire).
hallucination	həˌlu:səˈneɪʃən	in the pathological/psychological sense of "seeing or hearing something which is not there," 1640s, from L. hallucinationem (nom. hallucinatio), from pp. stem of hallucinari (see hallucinate). Hallucination is distinct from illusion in not necessarily involving a false belief. Related: Hallucinations.
halo	ˈheɪləʊ	1560s, from L. halo (nom. halos), from Gk. halos "disk of the sun or moon, ring of light around the sun or moon" (also "threshing floor" and "disk of a shield"), of unknown origin. Sense of "light around the head of a holy person or deity" first recorded 1640s. As a verb from 1801.
halt	hɔ:lt	âto walk unsteadily,â early 14c., from O.E. haltian âto be lame,â from the same source as halt (adj.). The meaning âmake a haltâ is 1650s, from halt (n.). As a command word, attested from 1796. Related: Halted; halting.
halting	ˈhɔ:ltɪŋ	"act of limping or walking lamely," early 14c., from prp. of halt (v.). Related: Haltingly.
ham-handed	ˈhæmˈhændid	"meat of a hog's hind leg used for food," 1630s, from O.E. hamm "hollow or bend of the knee," from P.Gmc. *hamma- (cf. O.N. höm, M.L.G., M.Du. hamme, O.H.G. hamma), from PIE *konemo- "shin bone" (cf. Gk. kneme "calf of the leg," O.Ir. cnaim "bone"). Ham-fisted (1928) was originally in reference to pilots who were heavy on the controls, as was ham-handed (by 1918). With hammen ifalden "with folded hams" was a M.E. way of saying "kneeling."
hamlet	ˈhæmlɪt	early 14c., from O.Fr. hamelet, dim. of hamel "village," itself a dim. of ham "village," from Frank. *haim (see home). Especially a village without a church.
hammer	ˈhæmə	O.E. hamor "hammer," from P.Gmc. *hamaraz (cf. O.S. hamur, M.Du., Du. hamer, O.H.G. hamar, Ger. Hammer. The O.N. cognate hamarr meant "stone, crag" (it's common in English place names), and suggests an original sense of "tool with a stone head," from PIE *akmen "stone, sharp stone used as a tool" (cf. O.C.S. kamy, Rus. kameni "stone"), from root *ak- "sharp" (see acme). Hammer and sickle as an emblem of Soviet communism attested from 1921, symbolizing industrial and agricultural labor.
hamper	ˈhæmpə	1835, "things important for a ship but in the way at certain times" (Klein's definition), from Fr. hamper "to impede." Hence top hamper, originally "upper masts, spars, rigging, etc. of a sailing ship."
hamster	ˈhæmstə	c.1600, from Ger. Hamster, from M.H.G. hamastra "hamster," probably from O.C.S. chomestoru "hamster" (the animal is native to S.E. Europe), perhaps a blend of Rus. chomiak and Lith. staras, both meaning "hamster." The older English name for it was German rat.
hamstring	ˈhæmstriŋ	1640s, "to disable, render useless," a figurative verbal extension from the noun hamstring "tendon at the back of the knee" (1560s), from ham "bend of the knee" (see ham (1)) + string. Cutting this would render a person or animal lame. Related: Hamstrung.  [I]n hamstring, -string is not the verb string; we do not string the ham, but do something to the tendon called the hamstring; the verb, that is, is made not from the two words ham & string, but from the noun hamstring. It must therefore make hamstringed. 
hand	hænd	O.E. hond, hand "hand; side; power, control, possession," from P.Gmc. *khanduz (cf. O.S., O.Fris., Du., Ger. hand, O.N. hönd, Goth. handus). The original O.E. plural handa was superseded in M.E. by handen, later hands. Meaning "person who does something with his hands" is from 1580s, hence "hired workman" (1630s) and "sailor in a ship's crew" (1660s). Clock and watch sense is from 1570s. Meaning "round of applause" is from 1838. The linear measure of 4 inches (originally 3) is from 1560s, now used only in giving the height of horses. The meaning "playing cards held in one player's hand" is from 1620s; that of "a round at a card game" is from 1620s. First hand, second hand, etc. (mid-15c.) are from the notion of something being passed down from hand to hand. Out of hand (1590s) is opposite of in hand "under control" (c.1200). Hand over fist (1825) is suggestive of sailors and fishermen hauling in nets. Hand jive is from 1958. To win something hands down (1855) is from horse racing, from a jockey's gesture of letting the reins go loose in an easy victory.  The Two Thousand Guinea Stakes was not the best contested one that it has been our fortune to assist at. ... [T]hey were won by Meteor, with Scott for his rider; who went by the post with his hands down, the easiest of all easy half-lengths. Wiseacre certainly did the best in his power to spoil his position, and Misdeal was at one time a little vexatious. ["The Sportsman," report from April 26, 1840]  To hand it to (someone) "acknowledge someone's ability" is slang from c.1906. Phrase on the one hand ... on the other hand is recorded from 1630s, a figurative use of the physical sense of hand in reference to position on one side or the other side of the body (as in the lefthand side), which goes back to O.E. Hands up! as a command from a policeman, robber, etc., is from 1873. Hand-to-mouth is from c.1500. Hand-in-hand attested from c.1500 as "with hands clasped;" figurative sense of "concurrently" recorded from 1570s.
handbook	ˈhændbuk	O.E. handboc; see hand (n.) + book. It translates L. manualis, and was displaced in M.E. by manual (from French), and later in part by enchiridion (from Greek). Reintroduced 1814, but execrated through much of 19c. as "that very ugly and very unnecessary word" [Trench].
handcuff	ˈhændˌkʌf	1640s as a decorative addition to a sleeve; 1690s as a type of restraining device, from hand (n.) + cuff (n.). The verb is first attested 1720. O.E. had hondcops "a pair of hand cuffs," but the modern word is a re-invention. Related: Handcuffed; handcuffing.
handicap	ˈhændikæp	"equalize chances of competitors," 1852, but implied in the horse-race sense from mid-18c., from handicap (n.). Meaning "put at a disadvantage" is from 1864. Earliest verbal sense, now obsolete, was "to gain as in a wagering game" (1640s). Related: Handicapped; handicapping.
handle	ˈhændl	O.E. handle, formed from hand (n.) with instrumental suffix -le indicating a tool in the way thimble was formed from thumb. The slang sense of "nickname" is first recorded 1870, originally U.S., from earlier expressions about adding a handle to (one's) name, i.e. a title such as Mister or Sir, attested from 1833. To fly off the handle (1833) is a figurative reference to an ax head (to be off the handle "be excited" is recorded from 1825, Amer.Eng.). To get a handle on "get control of" is first recorded 1972.   
handsome	ˈhænsəm	c.1400, handsom "easy to handle, ready at hand," from hand (n.) + -some. Sense extended to "fair size, considerable" (1570s), then "having fine form, good-looking" (1580s). Meaning "generous" (in handsome reward, etc.) first recorded 1680s.  [Americans] use the word "handsome" much more extensively than we do: saying that Webster made a handsome speech in the Senate: that a lady talks handsomely, (eloquently:) that a book sells handsomely. A gentleman asked me on the Catskill Mountain, whether I thought the sun handsomer there than at New York. [Harriet Martineau, "Society in America," 1837]  Related: Handsomeness. 
handy	ˈhændi	c.1300, "skilled with the hands" (implied in surnames), from hand (n.) + -y (2). Meaning "conveniently accessible" is from 1640s.
hang	hæŋ	late 15c., "a sling," from hang (v.). Meaning "a curtain" is from c.1500; that of "the way cloth hangs" is from 1797. To get the hang of (something) "become capable" is from 1834, American English. Perhaps originally in reference to a certain tool or feat, but, if so, its origin has been forgotten. It doesn't seem to have been originally associated with drapery or any other special use of hang.  'To get the hang of a thing,' is to get the knack, or habitual facility of doing it well. A low expression frequently heard among us. In the Craven Dialect of England is the word hank, a habit; from which this word hang may perhaps be derived. [John Russell Bartlett, "Dictionary of Americanisms," New York, 1848] 
hangar	ˈhæŋə	1852, "shed for carriages," from Fr. hangar "shed," probably from M.Fr. hanghart (14c.), perhaps an alteration of M.Du. *ham-gaerd "enclosure near a house" [Barnhart], or from M.L. angarium "shed in which horses are shod" [Gamillscheg, Klein]. Sense of "covered shed for airplanes" first recorded in English 1902, from French use in that sense.
hangdog	ˈhæŋdɔg	also hangdog, 1670s, "befitting a hang-dog," a despicable, degraded fellow, so called either from notion of being fit only to hang a dog (cf. cutthroat) or of being a low person (i.e. dog) fit only for hanging. As a noun from 1680s.
hanger	ˈhæŋə	early 15c., âone who hangs (something),â especially "hangman;" agent noun of hang. Meaning "something that is suspended" is late 15c. Meaning âthing from which something is hungâ is from 1690s. Specifically of coat or dress hangers from 1873. Hanger-on is from 1540s.
hangover	ˈhæŋˌəʊvə	also hang-over, 1894, "a survival, a thing left over from before," from hang (v.) + over. Meaning "after-effect of drinking too much" is first attested 1904, on notion of something left over from the night before.
hanker	ˈhæŋkə	c.1600, of unknown origin, probably from Flemish hankeren, related to Du. hunkeren "to hanker," of unknown origin; perhaps an intensive of M.Du. hangen "to hang" (see hang (v.)). If so, the notion is of "lingering about" with longing or craving. Related: Hankered; hankering.

O.S., Du. hard, O.N. harðr "hard," O.H.G. harto "extremely, very," Ger. hart, Goth. hardus "hard"), from PIE *kortu-, (cf. Gk. kratos "strength," kratys "strong"), from root *kar-/*ker- "hard." Meaning "difficult to do" is from c.1200. The adverb sense was also present in O.E. Hard of hearing preserves obsolete M.E. sense of "having difficulty in doing something." Hard liquor is 1879, Amer.Eng. (hard drink is from 1810; hard cider is from 1789), and this probably led to hard drugs (1955). Hard facts is from 1887; hard news is from 1938. Hard copy (as opposed to computer record) is from 1964; hard disk is from 1978. Hard up (1610s) is originally nautical, of steering (slang sense of "short of money" is from 1821), as is hard and fast (1680s), of a ship on shore. Hard times "period of poverty" is from 1705.  Hard money (1706) is specie, as opposed to paper. Hence 19c. U.S. hard (n.) "one who advocates the use of metallic money as the national currency" (1844). To play hard to get is from 1945. Hard rock as a pop music style recorded from 1967.

Transferred 1610s to "rough edge on metal," which may have been the source of the sense "rough sound of the letter -r-" (see burr).
hard-nosed	ˈhɑ:dˈnəʊzd	"stubborn," 1927, from hard + nose. Earlier of bullets or shells with hard tips, and of dogs that had difficulty following a scent.

hardhearted	ˈhɑ:dˈhɑ:tɪd	also hardhearted, "obdurate, unfeeling," late 12c. (implied in heard-heortnesse "hard-heartedness"); from hard + hearted. Sometimes in M.E. also meaning "bold, courageous" (15c.). Related: Hard-heartedly; hard-heartedness. Hard-heart "hard-hearted person" was in late O.E.
hardihood	ˈhɑ:di:ˌhʊd	name given to a man of great hardihood or bravery, c.1300, first applied to Edmund II, king of England (d.1016), later also to Oliver Cromwell and his troops. Old Ironsides as a nickname of U.S.S. "Constitution" dates from that ship's defeat of H.M.S. "Guerriere" on Aug. 19, 1812, in the War of 1812.
hardware	ˈhɑ:dwɛə	mid-15c., "small metal goods," from hard + ware (n.). In the sense of "physical components of a computer" it dates from 1947. Hardware store attested by 1789.

"means of joining," used of ship-planks, etc., also "settled government, order," related to harmos "fastenings of a door; shoulder," from PIE *ar-ti-, from *ar- "to fit together" (see arm (n.1)). Musical sense is oldest in English; that of "agreement of feeling, concord" is from late 14c.
harness	ˈhɑ:nis	"to put a harness on a draught animal," c.1300, from O.Fr. harneschier, from harnois (see harness (n.)); figurative sense is from 1690s. Related: Harnessed; harnessing.
harp	hɑ:p	O.E. hearpe, from P.Gmc. *kharpon- (cf. O.S. harpa "instrument of torture;" O.N. harpa, Du. harp, O.H.G. harpfa, Ger. Harfe "harp"). Late Latin harpa, source of words in some Romanic languages, is a borrowing from Germanic. Meaning "harmonica" is from 1887, short for mouth-harp. The harp seal (1784) is so called for the harp-shaped markings on its back.
harping	 	O.E. hearpian; see harp (n.). Cognate with M.Du., Du. harpen, M.H.G. harpfen, Ger. harfen. Figurative sense of "talk overmuch" (about something) first recorded mid-15c., originally to harp upon one string. Related: Harped; harping.

harpsichord	ˈhɑ:psɪˌkɔ:d	1610s, from Fr. harpechorde "harp string," from Mod.L. harpichordium (cf. It. arpicordo), from harpa (see harp (n.)) + chorda "string" (see cord). The -s- is unexplained, but it is attested in the earliest English forms.
harridan	ˈhærɪdn	1700, "one that is half Whore, half Bawd" ["Dictionary of the Canting Crew"]; "a decayed strumpet" [Johnson], probably from Fr. haridelle "a poore tit, or leane ill-favored jade," [Cotgrave, 1611], in French from 16c., of unknown origin.
harrow	ˈhærəʊ	"to drag a harrow over," especially in harrowing of Hell in Christian theology, early 14c., from hergian (see harry). In the figurative sense of "to wound the feelings, distress greatly" it is first attested c.1600 in Shakespeare. Related: Harrowed; harrowing.
harrowing	ˈhærəʊɪŋ	"extremely distressing, painful," 1799 (implied in harrowingly), from prp. of harrow (v.).
harry	ˈhæri:	masc. proper name, a familiar form of Henry. Weekley takes the overwhelming number of Harris and Harrison surnames as evidence that "Harry," not "Henry," was the M.E. pronunciation of Henry. Also cf. Harriet, English equivalent of Fr. Henriette, fem. dim. of Henri. Nautical slang Harriet Lane "preserved meat" (1896) refers to a famous murder victim whose killer allegedly chopped up her body.
harsh	hɑ:ʃ	late 14c., from harsh + -ness.
harshly	ˈhɑ:ʃlɪ	late 14c., from harsh + -ly (2).
harvest	ˈhɑ:vist	O.E. hærfest "autumn, period between August and November," from P.Gmc. *harbitas (cf. O.S. hervist, O.Fris., Du. herfst, Ger. Herbst "autumn," O.N. haust "harvest"), from PIE *kerp- "to gather, pluck, harvest" (cf. Skt. krpana- "sword," krpani "shears;" Gk. karpos "fruit," karpizomai "make harvest of;" L. carpere "to cut, divide, pluck;" Lith. kerpu "cut;" M.Ir. cerbaim "cut").  The borrowing of autumn and the use of fall in a seasonal sense gradually focused the meaning of harvest to "the time of gathering crops" (mid-13c.), then to the action itself and the product of the action (after c.1300). Figurative use by 1530s. Harvest home (1590s) is the occasion of bringing home the last of the harvest; harvest moon (1706) is that which is full within a fortnight of the autumnal equinox.
hassle	ˈhæsəl	1945, Amer.Eng., perhaps from U.S. Southern dialectal hassle "to pant, breathe noisily" (1928), of unknown origin; or perhaps from hatchel "to harass" (1800), which may be a variant of hazel, the name of the plant that furnished switches for whippings. Noted in 1946 as a show biz vogue word. As a verb, from 1951. Related: Hassled; hassling.
haste	heist	early 13c., from O.Fr. haste "haste, urgency, hastiness" (12c., Mod.Fr. hâte), from Frankish *haifst "violence," from W.Gmc. *haifstiz (cf. Goth. haifsts "strife," O.E. hæste "violent, vehement, impetuous"). To make haste is recorded by 1530s.
hasten	ˈheɪsən	1560s, extended form of haste (v.) with -en (1). Related: Hastened; hastening.
hasty	ˈheisti	mid-14c., "speedy, quick," by 1500s replacing or nativizing earlier hastif (c.1300) "eager, impetuous," from O.Fr. hastif "speedy, rapid; forward, advanced; rash, impetuous" (12c., Mod.Fr. hâtif), from haste (see haste). Meaning "requiring haste" is late 14c. (the sense in hasty pudding, 1590s, so called because it was made quickly); that of "rash" is from early 15c. Related: Hastiness. Old French also had a form hasti (for loss of terminal -f, cf. joli/jolif, etc.), which may have influenced the form of the English word.  The termination was doubtless from the first identified with native -i, -y, from OE -ig; and it is noticeable that the other Teutonic langs. have formed corresponding adjs. of that type: Du. haastig, Ger., Da., Sw. hastig. [OED] 
hatch	hætʃ	"opening," O.E. hæc (gen. hæcce) "fence, grating, gate," from P.Gmc. *hak- (cf. M.H.G. heck, Du. hek "fence, gate"). This apparently is the source of many of the Hatcher surnames; "one who lives near a gate." Sense of "plank opening in ship's deck" is first recorded mid-13c. Drinking phrase down the hatch first recorded 1931.
hatchback	ˈhætʃˌbæk	type of rear door of an automobile, 1970, from hatch (n.) + back (n.).
hatchet	ˈhætʃɪt	c.1300 "small ax" (mid-12c. in surnames), from O.Fr. hachete, dim. of hache "ax, battle-axe, pickaxe," possibly from a Germanic source, e.g. Frank. *happja, from P.Gmc. *hæbijo (cf. O.H.G. happa "sickle, scythe"), from PIE root *kop- "to beat, strike" (cf. Gk. kopis "knife;" Lith. kaplys "hatchet," kapoti "cut small;" O.C.S. skopiti "castrate"). In M.E., hatch itself was used in a sense "battle-axe." In 14c., hang up (one's) hatchet meant "stop what one is doing." Phrase bury the hatchet (1794) is from Native American peacemaking custom. Hatchet-man was originally California slang for "hired Chinese assassin" (1880), later extended figuratively to journalists who attacked the reputation of a public figure (1944).
hatred	ˈheitrid	early 13c., from hate + rare suffix -red, from O.E. ræden "state, condition," related to verb rædan "to advise, discuss, rule, read, guess." See read and cf. second element of kindred and proper names Æþelræd and Alfred.
haughtiness	ˈhɔ:tɪnɪs	1550s, from haughty + -ness. Earlier was haughtness (late 15c.).
haughty	ˈhɔ:ti:	1520s, an extension of haught (q.v.) "high in one's own estimation" by addition of -y (2) on model of might/mighty, naught/naughty, etc. M.E. also had hautif in this sense (mid-15c., from O.Fr. hautif). Related: Haughtily.
haul	hɔ:l	1660s, "act of hauling," from haul (v.). Meaning "something gained" is from 1776, perhaps on notion of "drawing" a profit, or of the catch from hauling fishing nets. Meaning "distance over which something must be hauled" (usually with long or short) is attested from 1873.
haunt	hɔ:nt	"place frequently visited," c.1300, also in M.E., "habit, custom" (early 14c.), from haunt (v.). The meaning "spirit that haunts a place, ghost" is first recorded 1843, originally in stereotypical U.S. black speech. 
haunting	ˈhɔ:ntɪŋ	1570s, from Puritan + -ism. Famously defined by H.L. Mencken (1920) as "the haunting fear that someone, somewhere may be happy."

haven	ˈheivn	O.E. hæfen "haven, port," from O.N. höfn "haven, harbor" or directly from P.Gmc. *hafno- (cf. Dan. havn, M.L.G. havene, Ger. Hafen), perhaps from PIE *kap- "to seize, hold contain" (see have) on notion of place that "holds" ships, but cf. also O.N. haf, O.E. hæf "sea" (see haff). Figurative sense of "refuge," now practically the only sense, is c.1200.
haversack	ˈhævəˌsæk	1749, from Fr. havresac (1670s), from Low Ger. hafersach "cavalry trooper's bag for horse provender," lit. "oat sack," from the common Germanic word for "oat" (see haver (1) + sack (n.1)).
havoc	ˈhævək	early 15c., from Anglo-Fr. havok in phrase crier havok "cry havoc" (late 14c.), a signal to soldiers to seize plunder, from O.Fr. havot "pillaging, looting," related to haver "to seize, grasp," hef "hook," probably from a Germanic source (see hawk (n.)), or from L. habere "to have, possess." General sense of "devastation" first recorded late 15c.
hawk	hɔ:k	"to hunt with a hawk," mid-14c., from hawk (n.).
hawker	ˈhɔ:kə	"one who hunts with a hawk," O.E. hafocere; see hawk (n.) + -er (1). For sense "one who sells or peddles," see hawk (v.1).
hawser	ˈhɔ:zə	"large rope used for mooring, towing, etc.," late 13c., from Anglo-Fr. haucer, from O.Fr. halcier, haucier, lit. "hoister," from V.L. *altiare, alteration of L.L. altare "make high," from altus "high" (see old). Altered in English on mistaken association with hawse and perhaps haul.
hay	hei	"grass mown," O.E. heg (Anglian), hieg, hig (W.Saxon) "grass cut or mown for fodder," from P.Gmc. *haujam (cf. O.N. hey, O.Fris. ha, M.Du. hoy, Ger. Heu, Goth. hawi "hay"), lit. "that which is cut," or "that which can be mowed," from PIE *kau- "to hew, strike" (cf. O.E. heawan "to cut;" see hew). Slang phrase hit the hay (pre-1880) was originally "to sleep in a barn;" hay in the general figurative sense of "bedding" (e.g. roll in the hay) is from 1903.
haystack	ˈheɪˌstæk	mid-15c., from hay + stack.
hazard	ˈhæzəd	"put something at stake in a game of chance," 1520s, from M.Fr. hasarder "to play at gambling" (15c.), from hasard (see hazard (n.)). Related: Hazarded; hazarding.

hazy	ˈheɪzi:	1620s, hawsey, nautical, of unknown origin. Some connect it with Ger. hase "hare," an animal which plays an important part in Germanic folklore, with many supernatural and unlucky aspects in medieval times (among the superstitions: a dead hare should not be brought aboard a fishing ship, and the word hare should not be spoken at sea). Another suggestion is O.E. hasu, haswe "gray." Related: Hazily; haziness.
head	hed	"head-first dive or plunge," 1849, from head (n.); as a type of pass or shot with the head in soccer, by 1906.
headfirst	ˈhedˈfɜ:st	1590s, "fall to great depth," from Fr. précipice, from L. praecipitium "a steep place," lit. "a fall or leap," from praeceps (gen. praecipitis) "steep, headlong, headfirst," from prae "before, forth" (see pre-) + caput "head" (see head). Meaning "steep face of rock" is recorded from 1630s.
heading	ˈhediŋ	c.1300, "a beheading," from prp. of head (v.). Meaning "advancing in a certain direction" is from c.1600. Meaning "title at the head of a portion of text" is from 1849.

healthful	ˈhelθful	late 14c., "wholesome, curative, saving," from health + -ful. Related: Healthfully; healthfulness.
heap	hi:p	O.E. heapian "collect, heap up, bring together;" from heap (n.). Related: Heaped; heaping. Cf. O.H.G. houfon "to heap."
hearing	ˈhiəriŋ	"perception by hear," early 13c., from prp. of hear. Meaning "a listening to evidence in a court of law" is from 1570s. 
hearken	ˈhɑ:kən	O.E. heorcnian, a suffixed form of *heorcian, root of hark; from P.Gmc. *hausjan (see hear). Harken is the usual spelling in U.S. and probably is better justified by etymology; hearken likely is from influence of hear.
hearsay	ˈhɪəˌseɪ	1530s, perhaps mid-15c., from phrase to hear say. 
heart	hɑ:t	O.E. heorte "heart; breast, soul, spirit, will, desire; courage; mind, intellect," from P.Gmc. *khertan- (cf. O.S. herta, O.Fris. herte, O.N. hjarta, Du. hart, O.H.G. herza, Ger. Herz, Goth. hairto), from PIE *kerd- "heart" (cf. Gk. kardia, L. cor, O.Ir. cride, Welsh craidd, Hittite kir, Lith. širdis, Rus. serdce "heart," Breton kreiz "middle," O.C.S. sreda "middle"). Spelling with -ea- is c.1500, reflecting what then was a long vowel, and remained when pronunciation shifted. Most of the figurative senses were present in O.E., including "intellect, memory," now only in by heart. Heart attack attested from 1935; heart disease is from 1864. The card game hearts is so called from 1886.
hearten	ˈhɑ:tn	c.1200, "to encourage," from heart + -en (1). A verb formed from figurative sense of heart. Related: Heartened; heartening.
heartfelt	ˈhɑ:tfelt	also heart-felt, 1734, from heart + past tense of feel (v.).

heath	hi:θ	O.E. hæð "untilled land, tract of wasteland," earlier "heather," influenced by O.N. heiðr "field," from P.Gmc. *haithiz (cf. O.S. hetha, O.H.G. heida "heather," Du. heide "heath," Goth. haiþi "field"), from PIE *kaito "forest, uncultivated land" (cf. O.Ir. ciad, Welsh coed, Breton coet "wood, forest").
heathen	ˈhi:ðən	O.E. hæðen "not Christian or Jewish," also as a noun, "heathen man" (especially of the Danes), merged with O.N. heiðinn (adj.) "heathen, pagan." Perhaps lit. "pertaining to one inhabiting uncultivated land," from heath + -en (2). But historically assumed to be from Goth. haiþno "gentile, heathen woman," used by Ulfilas in the first translation of the Bible into a Germanic language (cf. Mark vii:26, for "Greek"); if so it could be a derivative of Goth. haiþi "dwelling on the heath," but this sense is not recorded. It may have been chosen on model of L. paganus, with its root sense of "rural"  (see pagan), or for resemblance to Gk. ethne (see gentile), or it may be a literal borrowing of that Greek word, perhaps via Armenian hethanos [Sophus Bugge]. Like other basic words for exclusively Christian ideas (e.g. church) it likely would have come first into Gothic and then spread to other Germanic languages.
heave	hi:v	1570s, from heave (v.).
heavy-handed	ˈhevi:ˈhændɪd	also heavyhanded, 1630s, originally âwearyâ or âclumsy;â from heavy + hand. Sense of "overbearing" is first recorded 1883.
heavy-handedness	 	"heavy material used to steady a ship," 1520s, from M.E. bar "bare" (see bare; in this case "mere") + last "a load, burden," or borrowed from identical terms in North Sea Germanic and Scandinavian (cf. O.Dan. barlast, 14c.). "Mere" because not carried for commercial purposes. Du. balg-last "ballast," lit. "belly-load," is a folk-etymology corruption.
hecatomb	ˈhekəˌtəʊm	1590s, from Gk. hekatombe "offering of 100 oxen," but generally "a great public sacrifice," from hekaton "one hundred" (perhaps from hen, neut. of eis "one" + *katon "hundred") + bous "ox." The first month of the Attic calendar (corresponding to July-August) was Hekatombaion, in which sacrifices were made.
heckle	ˈhekəl	early 14c., "to comb (flax or hemp) with a heckle;" from heckle (n.) or from related M.Du. hekelen. Figurative meaning "to question severely in a bid to uncover weakness" is from late 18c. "Long applied in Scotland to the public questioning of parliamentary candidates" [OED].

"Old English helm never became an active term in the standard vocabulary of English." [Barnhart]

O.N. hemja "to bridle, curb," Swed. hämma "to stop, restrain," O.Fris. hemma "to hinder," M.Du., Ger. hemmen "to hem in, stop, hinder"), from PIE *kem- "to compress." Apparently the same root yielded O.E. hamm, common in place names (where it means "enclosure, land hemmed in by water or high ground, land in a river bend").

Slang in Reports: B.I.D. for "Brought in Dead" and "Dotty" are, [Mr. Sidney Holland of London Hospital] considers, permissible expressions, but he draws the line at "fitting" and "hæmorrhaging." Only such terms, he says, should be used as outside doctors will understand. We would say that on a point of such odiously bad taste he might have been much more severe. [Lavinia L. Dock, "The American Journal of Nursing," 1906] 
hemostat	ˈhi:məstæt	 
hence	hens	late 13c., hennes, from O.E. heonan "away, hence," from W.Gmc. *hin- (cf. O.S. hinan, O.H.G. hinnan, Ger. hinnen); related to O.E. her "here" (see here). With adverbial genitive -s.

["The Railroad Trainmen's Journal," vol. IX, July 1892]    In short, a Hill-Billie is a free and untrammelled white citizen of Alabama, who lives in the hills, has no means to speak of, dresses as he can, talks as he pleases, drinks whiskey when he gets it, and fires of his revolver as the fancy takes him.

[David Hackett Fischer, "Historians' Fallacies," 1970]
historic	hisˈtɔrik	1660s, probably a back formation from historical, perhaps influenced by Fr. historique. What is historic is noted or celebrated in history; what is historical deals with history.

O.S. hes, O.N. hass, Du. hees, O.H.G. heisi, Ger. heiser "hoarse"), perhaps originally meaning "dried out, rough." The -r- is difficult to explain; it is first attested c.1400, but it may indicate an unrecorded O.E. variant *hars. Related: Hoarsely; hoarseness.

The original hobbyhorse was a "Tourney Horse," a wooden or basketwork frame worn around the waist and held on with shoulder straps, with a fake tail and horse head attached, so the wearer appears to be riding a horse. These were part of church and civic celebrations at Midsummer and New Year's throughout England.

hockey	ˈhɔki	after an isolated reference from Ireland dated 1527 ("The horlinge of the litill balle with hockie stickes or staves ..."), the word is next recorded 1838 from W. Sussex; of unknown origin, perhaps related to M.Fr. hoquet "shepherd's staff, crook," dim. of O.Fr. hoc "hook." The hooked clubs with which the game is played resemble shepherds' staves. In N.Amer., ice hockey is distinguished from field hockey.
hodgepodge	ˈhɔdʒpɔdʒ	also hodge podge, hodge-podge, early 15c., hogpoch, alteration of hotchpotch (late 14c.)

hoist	hɔist	1540s, "to raise," earlier hoise (c.1500), probably originally past tense of M.E. hysse (late 15c.), which is probably from M.Du. hyssen (Du. hijsen) "to hoist," related to Low Ger. hissen and O.N. hissa upp "raise." A nautical word found in most European languages (e.g. Fr. hisser, It. issare, Sp. izar), but it is uncertain which had it first. Related: Hoisted; hoisting. In phrase hoist with one's own petard, it is the past participle.  For 'tis the sport, to have the engineer Hoist with his own petar: and it shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines, And blow them at the moon: O 'tis most sweet, When in one line two crafts directly meet.

The word itself was used in English in reference to Hitler's Jewish policies from 1942, but not as a proper name for them.

As an "inventor" and adapter to general purposes of the tools used by navvies and hodmen, "Hooligan" is an Irish character who occupies week by week the front of a comic literary journal called Nuggets, one of the series of papers published by Mr. James Henderson at Red Lion House. Previous to publication in London, "Hooligan" appears, I believe, in New York in a comic weekly, and in London he is set off against "Schneider," a German, whose contrainventions and adaptations appear in the Garland (a very similar paper to Nuggets), which also comes from Mr. Henderson's office. "Hooligan" and "Schneider" have been running, I should think, for four or five years.

Increase of population, which is filling the States out to their very borders, together with a new and extended network of railroads and other avenues, and an internal commerce which daily becomes more intimate, is rapidly bringing the States into a higher and more perfect social unity or consolidation. Thus, these antagonistic systems are continually coming into closer contact, and collision results.   Shall I tell you what this collision means? They who think that it is accidental, unnecessary, the work of interested or fanatical agitators, and therefor ephemeral, mistake the case altogether. It is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces, and it means that the United States must and will, sooner or later, become either entirely a slaveholding nation, or entirely a free-labor nation.

islet	ˈailit	1530s, from M.Fr. islette (Mod.Fr. îlette), dim. of isle (see isle).
isolate	ˈaisəleit	by 1786, a new formation from isolated (q.v.).  The translation of this work is well performed, excepting that fault from which few translations are wholly exempt, and which is daily tending to corrupt our language, the adoption of French expressions. We have here evasion for escape, twice or more times repeated; brigands very frequently; we have the unnecessary and foolish word isolate; and, if we mistake not, paralize, which at least has crept in through a similar channel. Translators cannot be too careful on this point, as it is a temptation to which they are constantly exposed. ["The British Critic," April 1799]  As a noun from 1890, from earlier adjectival use (1819).
isolation	ˌaɪsəˈleɪʃən	1800, noun of action from isolate, or else from Fr. isolation, noun of action from isoler (see isolated).

"likewise, just so, moreover," used to introduce a new fact or statement, probably from ita "thus," id "it" (see id) + adv. ending -tem (cf. idem "the same"). Thus "a statement or maxim" (of the kind formerly introduced by the word item), first recorded 1560s. Meaning "detail of information" (especially in a newspaper) is from 1819; item "sexually linked unmarried couple" is 1970, probably from notion of being an item in the gossip columns. Noun sense of "an article of any kind" (1570s) developed from adverbial sense of "moreover, in addition," which was used before every article in a list (such as an inventory or bill).
itemize	ˈaɪtəˌmaɪz	1864, Amer.Eng., from item + -ize. Related: Itemized; itemizing. Earlier verb was simply item (c.1600).

(late 12c. as a surname), Anglo-Fr. ivorie, from O.N.Fr. ivurie (12c.), from L. eboreus "of ivory," from ebur (gen. eboris) "ivory," probably via Phoenician from an African source (cf.

Meaning "paper wrapper of a book" is first attested 1894. 
jade	dʒeid	ornamental stone, 1721, earlier iada (1590s), from Fr. le jade, error for earlier l'ejade, from Sp. piedra de (la) ijada (1560s), "stone of colic, pain in the side" (jade was thought to cure this), from V.L. *iliata, from L. ilia (pl.) "flanks, kidney area" (see ileum).

jamboree	ˌdʒæmbəˈri:	1866, represented as typical of American English, perhaps from jam (n.) on pattern of shivaree [Barnhart]. For the second element, Weekley suggests Fr. bourree, a kind of rustic dance. Klein thinks the whole thing is of Hindu origin (but he credits its introduction to English, mistakenly, to Kipling). Boy Scouts use is from 1920. Noted earlier as a term in cribbage:  Jamboree signifies the combination of the five highest cards, as, for example, the two Bowers [jacks], Ace, King, and Queen of trumps in one hand, which entitles the holder to count sixteen points. The holder of such a hand, simply announces the fact, as no play is necessary; but should he play the hand as a Jambone, he can count only eight points, whereas he could count sixteen if he played it, or announced it as a Jamboree.

See zeal. In biblical language (early 13c.) "tolerating no unfaithfulness."  Most of the words for 'envy' ... had from the outset a hostile force, based on 'look at' (with malice), 'not love,' etc. Conversely, most of those which became distinctive terms for 'jealousy' were originally used also in a good sense, 'zeal, emulation.' [Buck, pp.1138-9]  Among the ways to express this in other tongues are Swed. svartsjuka, lit. "black-sick," from phrase bara svarta strumpor "wear black stockings," also "be jealous." Dan. skinsyg "jealous," lit. "skin-sick," is from skind "hide, skin" said to be explained by Swedish dialectal expression fa skinn "receive a refusal in courtship."

Marine Insurance writers' restoration of the earlier form and original sense of the 15c. word that had become jetsam, probably because jetsam had taken on a sense of "things cast overboard" and an unambiguous word was needed for "act of throwing overboard." M.E. jetteson (n.)

The word was in use earlier than the career of U.S. humorist Josh Billings, pseudonym of Henry Wheeler Shaw (1818-1885), who did not begin to write and lecture until 1860; but his popularity after 1869 may have influence that of the word.About the most originality that any writer can hope to achieve honestly is to steal with good judgment.

However, according to Australian linguist R.M.W. Dixon ("The Languages of Australia," Cambridge, 1980), the word probably is from Guugu Yimidhirr (Endeavour River-area Aborigine language) /gaNurru/ "large black kangaroo."In 1898 the pioneer ethnologist W.E. Roth wrote a letter to the Australasian pointing out that gang-oo-roo did mean 'kangaroo' in Guugu Yimidhirr, but this newspaper correspondence went unnoticed by lexicographers. Finally the observations of Cook and Roth were confirmed when in 1972 the anthropologist John Haviland began intensive study of Guugu Yimidhirr and again recorded /gaNurru/. [Dixon] Kangaroo court is Amer.Eng., first recorded 1850 in a Southwestern context (also mustang court), from notion of proceeding by leaps.

keep	ki:p	late O.E. cepan "to seize, hold," also "to observe," from P.Gmc. *kopijanan, but with no certain connection to other languages. It possibly is related to O.E. capian "to look," from P.Gmc. *kap- (cepan was used c.1000 to render L. observare), which would make the basic sense "to keep an eye on."The word prob. belongs primarily to the vulgar and non-literary stratum of the language; but it comes up suddenly into literary use c.1000, and that in many senses, indicating considerable previous development. [OED]Sense of "preserve, maintain" is from mid-14c. Meaning "to maintain in proper order" is from 1550s; meaning "financially support and privately control" (usually in reference to mistresses) is from 1540s. Related: Kept; keeping.

ketchup	ˈketʃəp	1711, said to be from Malay kichap, but probably not original to Malay. It might have come from Chinese koechiap "brine of fish," which, if authentic, perhaps is from the Chinese community in northern Vietnam [Terrien de Lacouperie, in "Babylonian and Oriental Record," 1889, 1890]. Catsup (earlier catchup, 1680s) is a failed attempt at Anglicization, still in use in U.S., influenced by cat and sup.  Originally a fish sauce, the word came to be used in English for a wide variety of spiced gravies and sauces; "Apicius Redivivus; or, the Cook's Oracle," by William Kitchiner, London, 1817, devotes 7 pages to recipes for different types of catsup (his book has 1 spelling of ketchup, 72 of catsup), including walnut, mushroom, oyster, cockle and mussel, tomata, white (vinegar and anchovies figure in it), cucumber, and pudding catsup. Chambers's Encyclopaedia (1870) lists mushroom, walnut, and tomato ketchup as "the three most esteemed kinds." Tomato ketchup emerged c.1800 in U.S., predominated from early 20c.

kidnap	ˈkidnæp	1670s; see kidnap (though this word is attested a few years earlier).
kidney	ˈkidni	early 14c., of unknown origin, originally kidenere, perhaps a compound of O.E. cwið "womb" (see bowel) + ey "egg" (see egg (n.)) in reference to the shape of the organ. Figurative sense of "temperament" is from 1550s. Kidney bean is from 1540s, so called for its shape.
killjoy	ˈkildʒɔi	also kill-joy, 1776, from kill (v.) + joy. Formerly used with other stems (cf. kill-courtesy "boorish person," kill-cow "bully, big man," etc.). 
kin	kin	c.1200, from O.E. cynn "family; race; kind, sort, rank; nature; gender, sex," from P.Gmc. *kunjam "family" (cf. O.Fris. kenn, O.S. kunni, O.N. kyn, O.H.G. chunni "kin, race;" Dan., Swed. kön, M.Du., Du. kunne "sex, gender;" Goth. kuni "family, race," O.N. kundr "son," Ger. Kind "child"), from PIE *gen(e)- "to produce" (see genus).
kindle	ˈkɪndl	c.1200, cundel, "to set fire to, to start on fire," probably from a Scandinavian source akin to O.N. kynda "to kindle, to light a fire," Swed. quindla "kindle," of uncertain origin, + frequentative suffix -le. Figurative use from c.1300. Intransitive sense "to begin to burn, to catch fire" is from c.1400. Related: Kindled; kindling. Influenced in form, and sometimes in M.E. in sense, with kindel "to give birth" (of animals), "bring forth, produce" (c.1200), from kindel (n.) "offspring of an animal, young one," from O.E. gecynd (see kind (n.)) + -el.
kindred	ˈkɪndrɪd	c.1200, kinraden, compound of kin (q.v.) + -rede, from O.E. ræden "condition, rule," related to rædan "to advise, rule" (see read). With intrusive -d- (17c.) probably for phonetic reasons (cf. thunder) but perhaps encouraged by kind (n.). As an adjective, 1520s, from the noun.
kinetic	kɪˈnetɪk	"relating to motion," 1841, from Gk. kinetikos "moving, putting in motion," from kinetos "moved," verbal adjective of kinein "to move" (see cite).  Buster Keaton's subject was kinetic man, a being he approached with the almost metaphysical awe we reserve for a Doppelgänger. This being was, eerily, himself, played by himself, then later in a projection room, watched by himself: an experience never possible to any generation of actors in the previous history of the world. [Hugh Kenner, "The Counterfeiters," 1968]  Related: Kinetical; kinetically.
kingdom	ˈkiŋdəm	O.E. cyningdom; see king + -dom. Cognate with O.S. kuningdom, M.Du. koninghdom, O.N. konungdomr. The usual O.E. word was cynedom; M.E. also had kingrick (for second element, see Reichstag). Meaning "one of the realms of nature" is from 1690s. Kingdom-come "the next world" (1785) is from the Lord's Prayer.
kinship	ˈkɪnˌʃɪp	by 1764, from kin + -ship. A more pure word than relationship, which covers the same sense but is a hybrid.
kiosk	ˈki:ˌɔsk	1620s, "open pavilion," from Fr. kiosque (17c.), from Turk. koshk, kiöshk "pavilion, palace," from Pers. kushk "palace, portico." Later of newsstands (1865). Modern sense influenced by British telephone kiosk (1928).
kismet	ˈkismet	"fate, destiny," 1834, from Turkish qismet, from Arabic qismah, qismat "portion, lot, fate," from root of qasama "he divided."  From a nation of enthusiasts and conquerors, the Osmanlis became a nation of sleepers and smokers. They came into Europe with the sword in one hand and the Koran in the other: were they driven out of their encampment, it would be with the Koran in one hand and the pipe in the other, crying: 'Kismet! Kismet! Allah kehrim!' (God hath willed it! God is great!) [Dr. James O. Noyes, "The Ottoman Empire," "The Knickerbocker," October 1858]  Popularized as the title of a novel in 1877.
kit	kit	late 13c., "round wooden tub," perhaps from M.Du. kitte "jug, tankard, wooden container," of unknown origin. Meaning "collection of personal effects," especially for traveling (originally in reference to a soldier), is from 1785; that of "outfit of tools for a workman" is from 1851. Of drum sets, by 1929. Meaning "article to be assembled by the buyer" is from 1930s.
kitsch	kɪtʃ	1926, from Ger. kitsch, lit. "gaudy, trash," from dialectal kitschen "to smear."  What we English people call ugliness in German art is simply the furious reaction against what Germans call süsses Kitsch, the art of the picture postcard, and of what corresponds to the royalty ballad. It has for years been their constant reproach against us that England is the great country of Kitsch. Many years ago a German who loved England only too well said to me, 'I like your English word plain; it is a word for which we have no equivalent in German, because all German women are plain.' He might well have balanced it by saying that English has no equivalent for the word Kitsch. [Edward J. Dent, "The Music of Arnold Schönberg," "The Living Age," July 9, 1921] 
kitten	ˈkitn	late 14c., probably from an Anglo-French variant of O.Fr. chitoun (O.N.Fr. caton) "little cat," from chat "cat," from L.L. cattus (see cat). Applied playfully to a young girl, a sweetheart, from 1870.
kleptomania	ˌkleptəˈmeɪni:ə	1830, formed from mania + Gk. kleptes "thief," from kleptein "to steal, act secretly," from PIE *klep- "to steal," an extention of root *kel- "to cover, conceal" (see cell; cf. L. clepere "to steal, listen secretly to," O.Pruss. au-klipts "hidden," O.C.S. poklopu "cover, wrapping," Goth. hlifan "to steal," hliftus "thief"). Much-derided 19c. as a fancy term for old-fashioned thievery and an opportunity for the privileged to claim a psychological motive for criminal misbehavior.  There is a popular belief that some of the criminal laws under which the poor are rigorously punished are susceptible of remarkable elasticity when the peccadilloes of the rich are brought under judgment, and that there is some truth in the old adage which declares that "one man may steal a horse where another dare not look over the hedge." This unwholesome distrust is not likely to diminish if, in cases of criminal prosecutions where so-called respectable persons commit theft without sufficiently obvious motive for the act, they have their crime extenuated on the plea of kleptomania, as has recently occurred in several notable instances. ["Kleptomania," "The Lancet," Nov. 16, 1861] 
knack	næk	mid-14c., "deception, trick, device," of uncertain origin, probably from a Low German word meaning "a sharp sounding blow" (cf. M.E. knak, late 14c.; Ger. knacken "to crack"), of imitative origin. Sense of "special skill" is first recorded 1580s, if this is in fact the same word.
knackered	ˈnækəd	"worn out, tired," see knacker (v.).
knave	neɪv	1520s, from knave + -ery.
knead	ni:d	O.E. cnedan "to knead," from P.Gmc. *knedanan (cf. O.S. knedan, M.Du. cneden, Du. kneden, O.H.G. knetan, Ger. kneten, O.N. knoða "to knead"). Originally a strong verb (past tense cnæd, pp. cneden).
kneel	ni:l	O.E. cneowlian, from cneow (see knee); cf. M.L.G. knelen, M.Du. cnielen, Du. knielen Goth. knussjan. Past tense knelt is a modern formation (19c.) on analogy of feel/felt, etc. Related: Kneeling.
knell	nel	O.E. cnyll "sound made by a bell when struck or rung slowly," perhaps of imitative origin. The Welsh cnull "death-bell" appears to be a borrowing from English. For vowel evolution, see bury.
knit	nit	mid-15c., agent noun from knit (v.).
knob	nɔb	late 14c., knobe, probably from a Scandinavian or German source (cf. M.L.G. knobbe "knob," M.Du. cnoppe, Du. knop, O.Fris. knopp, knapp, O.H.G. knopf, Ger. Knopf "button," O.N. knyfill "short horn"). Meaning "knoll, isolated round hill" is first recorded 1640s, especially in U.S.

know-how	ˈnəʊˌhaʊ	 
knowledgeable	ˈnɔlɪdʒəbəl	also knowledgable, c.1600, "capable of being known, recognizable" (a sense now obsolete), from knowledge in its Middle English verbal sense + -able. The modern sense of "having knowledge, displaying knowledge" is from 1829 and probably a new formation.
knuckle	ˈnʌkl	mid-14c., knokel "finger joint; any joint of the body, especially a knobby one; morbid lump or swelling;" common Germanic (cf. M.L.G. knökel, M.Du. cnockel, Ger. knöchel), lit. "little bone," a dim. of P.Gmc. root *knuck- "bone" (cf. Ger. Knochen "bone). As a verb from 1740, originally in the game of marbles. To knuckle down "apply oneself earnestly" is 1864 in Amer.Eng., extended from marbles (putting a knuckle on the ground in assuming the hand position preliminary to shooting); to knuckle under "submit, give in" is first recorded 1740, supposedly from the former more general sense of "knuckle" and here meaning "knee," hence "to kneel." The face-busting knuckle-duster is from 1858 (a duster was a type of protective coat worn by workmen).
kudos	ˈku:ˌdəʊz	"fame, renown," 1799, probably originally in university slang, from Gk. kydos "glory, fame," especially in battle, lit. "that which is heard of" (see caveat). A singular noun in Greek, but the final -s often is mistaken as a plural suffix in English, leading to the barbarous back-formation kudo (attested by 1936).
label	ˈleibəl	"to affix a label to," c.1600, see label (n.); figurative sense of "to categorize" is from 1853. Related: Labeled; labeling; labelled; labelling.

labyrinth	ˈlæbəˌrɪnθ	c.1400, laberynthe (late 14c. in Latinate form laborintus) "labyrinth, maze," figuratively "bewildering arguments," from L. labyrinthus, from Gk. labyrinthos "maze, large building with intricate passages," especially the structure built by Daedelus to hold the Minotaur near Knossos in Crete, from a pre-Greek language; perhaps related to Lydian labrys "double-edged axe," symbol of royal power, which fits with the theory that the labyrinth was originally the royal Minoan palace on Crete and meant "palace of the double-axe." Used in English for "maze" early 15c., and in figurative sense of "confusing state of affairs" (1540s).
lace	leis	c.1200, "fasten (clothing, etc.) with laces and ties;" see lace (n.). Also "tighten (a garment) by pulling its laces" (early 14c.). To lace coffee, etc., with a dash of liquor (1670s) originally was used of sugar, and comes via the notion of "to ornament or trim." Related: Laced; lacing. Laced mutton was "an old word for a whore" [Johnson]. 
lacerate	ˈlæsəˌreɪt	early 15c., from L. laceratus, pp. of lacerare "tear to pieces, mangle," figuratively, "to slander, censure, abuse," from lacer "torn, mangled," from PIE root *lek- "to rend, tear" (cf.

lachrymose	ˈlækrəˌməʊs	1660s, "tear-like," from L. lacrimosus "tearful, sorrowful, weeping," also "causing tears, lamentable," from lacrima "tear," a dialect-altered borrowing of Gk. dakryma "tear," from dakryein "to shed tears," from dakry "tear," from PIE *dakru-/*draku- (see tear (n.)). Meaning "given to tears, tearful" is first attested 1727; meaning "of a mournful character" is from 1822. The -d- to -l- alteration in Latin is the so-called "Sabine -L-," cf. L. olere "smell," from root of odor, and Ulixes, the Latin form of Greek Odysseus. The Medieval Latin practice of writing -ch- for -c- before Latin -r- also altered anchor, pulchritude, sepulchre. The -y- is pedantic, from belief in a Greek origin. M.E. had lacrymable "tearful" (mid-15c.).
lack	læk	also lack-luster, c.1600, first attested in "As You Like It," from lack + luster. Combinations with lack- were frequent in 16c., e.g. lackland (1590s), of a landless man; lack-Latin (1530s), of an ignorant priest.
lackadaisical	ˌlækəˈdeɪzɪkəl	1768 (Sterne), from interjection lackadaisy "alas, alack" (1748), an alteration of lack-a-day (1690s), from alack the day (1590s). Hence, "given to crying 'lack-a-day,' vapidly sentimental." Sense probably altered by influence of lax. Related: Lackadaisically.
lackey	ˈlæki:	1520s, "footman, running footman, valet," from M.Fr. laquais "foot soldier, footman, servant" (15c.), of unknown origin; perhaps from O.Prov. lacai, from lecai "glutton, covetous," from lecar "to lick." Alternative etymology is via French from Catalan alacay, from Arabic al-qadi "the judge." Yet another guess traces it through Sp. lacayo, from It. lacchè, from Mod.Gk. oulakes, from Turk. ulak "runner, courier." This suits the original sense better, but OED says It. lacchè is from French. Sense of "servile follower" appeared 1580s. As a political term of abuse it dates from 1939 in communist jargon.
lackluster	'læk	also lack-luster, c.1600, first attested in "As You Like It," from lack + luster. Combinations with lack- were frequent in 16c., e.g. lackland (1590s), of a landless man; lack-Latin (1530s), of an ignorant priest.

layer	ˈleiə	late 14c., "one who or that lays" (especially stones, "a mason"), agent noun from lay (v.).

leakage	ˈli:kɪdʒ	late 15c., from leak (v.) + -age.
lean	li:n	"thin, spare, with little flesh or fat," c.1200, from O.E. hlæne "lean, thin," possibly from hlænan "cause to lean or bend," from P.Gmc. *khlainijan, which would connect it to O.E. hleonian (see lean (v.)).

The noun meaning "lean animals or persons" is from c.1200, from the adjective.

O.E. belifan, Ger. bleiben, Goth. bileiban "to remain"), from root *laf- "remnant, what remains," from PIE *leip- "to stick, adhere;" also "fat." The Germanic root has only the sense "remain, continue," which also is in Gk. lipares "persevering, importunate." But this usually is regarded as a development from the primary PIE sense of "adhere, be sticky" (cf. Lith. lipti, O.C.S. lipet "to adhere," Gk. lipos "grease," Skt. rip-/lip- "to smear, adhere to."  Seemingly contradictory meaning of "depart" (early 13c.) comes from notion of "to leave behind" (as in to leave the earth "to die;" to leave the field "retreat").

lechery	ˈletʃəri:	c.1200, from O.Fr. lecherie "impertinence, deceit," from lecheor (see lecher).  The priests had excellent cause to forbid us lechery: this injunction, by reserving to them acquaintance with and absolution for these private sins, gave them an incredible ascendancy over women, and opened up to them a career of lubricity whose scope knew no limits. [Marquis de Sade] 
lectern	ˈlektən	early 14c., lettorne, lettron, from O.Fr. letron, from M.L. lectrinum, from L.L. lectrum "lectern," from root of L. legere "to read" (see lecture). Half-re-Latinized in 15c.

Cf. Ger. Bein "leg," in O.H.G. "bone, leg." Replaced O.E. shank. Of furniture supports from 1670s. The meaning "a part or stage of a journey or race" (1920) is from earlier sailing sense of "a run made on a single tack" (1867), which was usually qualified as long leg, short leg, etc. Slang phrase shake a leg "dance" is attested from 1881.

First used in Coverdale Bible, where it renders Hebrew cara'ath, which apparently was a comprehensive term for skin diseases.

Used originally of dictionaries of Greek, Syriac, Hebrew and Arabic, since these typically were in Latin and in Modern Latin lexicon, not dictionarius, was the preferred word. The modern sense of "vocabulary proper to some sphere of activity" (1640s) is a figurative extension.

This is the attitude of mind which has come to be known as liberal. It implies vigorous convictions, tolerance for the opinions of others, and a persistent desire for sound progress. It is a method of approach which has played a notable and constructive part in our history, and which merits a thorough trial today in the attack on our absorbingly interesting American task. [Guy Emerson, "The New Frontier," 1920]

Meaning "dissolute or licentious person" first recorded 1590s; the darkening of meaning being perhaps due to misunderstanding of L. libertinus in Acts vi:9. As an adjective by 1570s.
liberty	ˈlibəti	late 14c., "free choice, freedom to do as one chooses," from O.Fr. liberté "freedom, liberty, free will" (14c.), from L. libertatem (nom. libertas) "freedom, condition of a free man; absence of restraint; permission," from liber "free" (see liberal)The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure it is right.

The parasitic -b began to appear late 1500s for no etymological reason (perhaps by influence of limb (n.2)). In Old and Middle English, and until lately in dialects, it could mean "any visible body part."The lymmes of generacion were shewed manyfestly. [Caxton, "The subtyl historyes and fables of Esope, Auyan, Alfonce, and Poge," 1484]Hence, limb-lifter "fornicator" (1570s).

limber	ˈlɪmbə	"detachable forepart of a gun carriage," 1620s, from M.E. lymer (early 15c.), earlier lymon (c.1400), probably from O.Fr. limon "shaft," a word perhaps of Celtic origin, or possibly from Germanic and related to limb (n.1).

limerick	ˈlɪmərɪk	nonsense verse of five lines, 1896, perhaps from the county and city in Ireland, but if so the connection is obscure. Often (after OED's Murray) attributed to a party game in which each guest in turn made up a nonsense verse and all sang a refrain with the line "Will you come up to Limerick?" but he reported this in 1898 and earlier evidence is wanting. Or perhaps from Learic, from Edward Lear (1812-1888) English humorist who popularized the form. Earliest examples are in French, which further complicates the quest for the origin. OED's first record of the word is in a letter of Aubrey Beardsley. The place name is lit. "bare ground," from Ir. Liumneach, from lom "bare, thin." It was famous for hooks.

limnetic	lɪmˈnetɪk	 
limousine	ˈlimuzi:n	1902, "enclosed automobile with open driver's seat," from Fr. limousine, from Limousin, region in central France, originally an adjective referring to its chief city, Limoges, from L. Lemovices, name of a people who lived near there, perhaps named in ref. to their elm spears or bows. The Latin adjective form of the name, Lemovicinus, is the source of Fr. Limousin. Modern automobile meaning evolved from perceived similarity of the car's profile to a type of hood worn by the inhabitants of that province. Since 1930s, synonymous in Amer.Eng. with "luxury car;" applied from 1959 to vehicles that take people to and from large airports. Limousine liberal first attested 1969.

linear	ˈliniə	1640s, from Fr. linéaire, from from L. linearis "belonging to a line," from linea "string, line" (see line (n.)). Essentially the same word as lineal; "in L. linearis the original suffix -alis was dissimilated to -aris, but in Late Latin this rule was no longer productive and the formation or re-formation in -alis remained unchanged."

Laib, Goth. hlaifs "bread, loaf"), of uncertain origin, perhaps connected to O.E. hlifian "to raise higher, tower," on the notion of the bread rising as it bakes, but it is unclear whether "loaf" or "bread" is the original sense.

The Norse word also is cognate with O.E. læn "gift," which did not survive into M.E., but its derived verb lænan is the source of lend. As a verb, loan is attested from 1540s, perhaps earlier, and was formerly current, but has now been supplanted in England by lend, though it survives in Amer.Eng.

Leid "sorrow;" Fr. laid "ugly," from Frankish *laid), from PIE root *leit- "to detest." Weakened meaning "averse, disinclined" is attested from late 14c.

lobster	ˈlɔbstə	marine shellfish, O.E. loppestre "lobster, locust," corruption of L. locusta, lucusta "lobster, locust," by influence of O.E. loppe "spider," a variant of lobbe. The ending of O.E. loppestre is the fem. agent noun suffix (cf. Baxter, Webster; see -ster), which approximated the Latin sound. Perhaps a transferred use of the Latin word; trilobite fossils in Worcestershire limestone quarries were known colloquially as locusts, which seems to be the generic word for "unidentified arthropod," as apple is for "foreign fruit." OED says the Latin word originally meant "lobster or some similar crustacean, the application to the locust being suggested by the resemblance in shape." Locusta in the sense "lobster" also appears in French (langouste now "crawfish, crayfish," but in Old French "lobster" and "locust;" a 13c. psalter has God giving over the crops of Egypt to the langoustes) and Old Cornish (legast).

[Clarendon, "History of the Rebellion," 1647]
locale	ləʊˈkæl	1772, local, from Fr. local, noun use of local (adj.), from L. locus "place" (see locus).

log	lɔɡ	unshaped large piece of tree, early 14c., of unknown origin. O.N. had lag "felled tree" (from stem of liggja "to lie"), but on phonological grounds many etymologists deny that this is the root of English log. Instead, they suggest an independent formation meant to "express the notion of something massive by a word of appropriate sound." OED compares clog (n.) in its original Middle English sense "lump of wood." Log cabin (1770) in Amer.Eng. has been a figure of the honest pioneer since the 1840 presidential campaign of William Henry Harrison. Falling off a log as a type of something easy to do is from 1839.

L. longus, O.Pers. darga-, Pers. dirang, Skt. dirghah, Gk. dolikhos "long," Gk. endelekhes "perpetual," L. indulgere "to indulge"), from root *del- "long." The adverb is from O.E. lange, longe, from the adjective; to be not long for this world "soon to die" is from 1714.

In M.E., "any source of pleasure or delight," also "an appetite," also "a liking for a person," also "fertility" (of soil). Sense of "sinful sexual desire, degrading animal passion" (now the main meaning) developed in late O.E. from the word's use in Bible translations (e.g. lusts of the flesh to render L. concupiscentia carnis [I John ii:16]); the cognate words in other Germanic languages tend still to mean simply "pleasure."

lynch	lɪntʃ	1835, from earlier Lynch law (1811), likely named after William Lynch (1742-1820) of Pittsylvania, Virginia, who c.1780 led a vigilance committee to keep order there during the Revolution. Other sources trace the name to Charles Lynch (1736-1796) a Virginia magistrate who fined and imprisoned Tories in his district c.1782, but the connection to him is less likely. Originally any sort of summary justice, especially by flogging; narrowing of focus to "extralegal execution by hanging" is 20c. Lynch mob is attested from 1838. The surname is perhaps from Ir. Loingseach "sailor." Cf. earlier Lydford law, from a place in Dartmoor, England, "where was held a Stannaries Court of summary jurisdiction" [Weekley], hence:  Lydford law: is to hang men first, and indite them afterwards.

"dance of the Maccabees" (leaders of the Jewish revolt against Syro-Hellenes; see Maccabees). The association with the dance of death seems to be via vivid descriptions of the martyrdom of the Maccabees in the Apocryphal books. The abstracted sense of "gruesome" is first attested 1842 in French, 1889 in English.  The typical form which the allegory takes is that of a series of pictures, sculptured or painted, in which Death appears, either as a dancing skeleton or as a shrunken corpse wrapped in grave-clothes to persons representing every age and condition of life, and leads them all in a dance to the grave.

Meaning "soldier who serves on a ship" is from 1670s, a separate borrowing from Fr. marine, from the French adjective.

"Belay there!" cried the captain; "you may tell that to the marines, but I'll be d----d if the sailors will believe it." ["John Moore," "The Post-Captain; or, the Wooden Walls Well Manned," 1805]  The book, a rollicking sea romance/adventure novel, was popular in its day and the remark is a recurring punch line in it (repeated at least four times).

According to Watkins the Latin word is from *Mawort- "name of an Italic deity who became the god of war at Rome ...."

He was, to use a Western expression, a 'regular heart-smasher among the women; and it may not be improper to state, just here, that no one had a more exalted opinion of his capabilities in that line than the aforesaid 'Jo' himself. ["Harper's New Monthly Magazine," March 1861]    He had a weakness to be considered a regular masher of female hearts and a very wicked young man with the fair sex generally, but there was not a well-authenticated instance of his ever having broken a heart in his life, nor likely to be one.

In the neighboring Green mountain districts, one or more most annoying species of Simulium that there abound, are daily designated in common conversation as the midges, or, as the name is often corrupted, the midgets. From Dr. Harris' treatise it appears that the same name is in popular use for the same insects in Maine. The term is limited in this country, we believe, exclusively to those minute insects, smaller than the musketoe, which suck the blood of other animals. ["Transactions of the New-York State Agricultural Society," vol. VI, Albany, 1847]  Transferred sense of "very small person" is attested by 1854. It is also noted mid-19c. as a pet form of Margaret.

Maus "mouse, muscle," Arabic 'adalah "muscle," 'adal "field mouse." In M.E., lacerte, from the Latin word for "lizard," also was used as a word for a muscle.  Musclez & lacertez bene one selfe þing, Bot þe muscle is said to þe fourme of mouse & lacert to þe fourme of a lizard. [Guy de Chauliac, "Grande Chirurgie," c.1425]  Hence muscular and mousy are relatives, and a M.E. word for "muscular" was lacertous, "lizardy."

"to stand with one's nose in the air" (or, possibly, "to sniff about" like a dog who has lost the scent), from muse "muzzle," from Gallo-Romance *musa "snout," of unknown origin. Probably influenced in sense by muse (n.). Related: Mused; musing.
mushroom	ˈmʌʃrum	mid-15c. (attested as a surname, John Mussheron, from 1327), from Anglo-Fr. musherun, perhaps from L.L. mussirionem (nom. mussirio), though this may as well be borrowed from French. Barnhart says "of uncertain origin." Klein calls it "a word of pre-Latin origin, used in the North of France;" OED says it usually is held to be a derivative of Fr. mousse "moss," and Weekley agrees, saying it is properly "applied to variety which grows in moss."

nice	nais	late 13c., "foolish, stupid, senseless," from O.Fr. nice "silly, foolish," from L. nescius "ignorant," lit. "not-knowing," from ne- "not" (see un-) + stem of scire "to know."

In 16c.-17c. it is often difficult to determine exactly what is meant when a writer uses this word. By 1926, it was pronounced "too great a favorite with the ladies, who have charmed out of it all its individuality and converted it into a mere diffuser of vague and mild agreeableness." [Fowler]"I am sure," cried Catherine, "I did not mean to say anything wrong; but it is a nice book, and why should I not call it so?" "Very true," said Henry, "and this is a very nice day, and we are taking a very nice walk; and you are two very nice young ladies. Oh! It is a very nice word indeed! It does for everything."

Another suggestion is that the word is from an O.Fr. noun derived from nichier "to nestle, nest, build a nest," via Gallo-Romance *nidicare from L. nidus "nest;" but that has difficulties, too. Figurative sense is first recorded 1725. Biological use dates from 1927.

nickel	ˈnikəl	1755, coined in 1754 by Swedish mineralogist Axel von Cronstedt (1722-1765) from shortening of Swed. kopparnickel "copper-colored ore" (from which it was first obtained), a half-translation of Ger. Kupfernickel, lit. "copper demon," from Kupfer (see copper) + Nickel "demon, goblin, rascal" (a pet form of masc. proper name Nikolaus, cf. English Old Nick "the devil;" see Nicholas); the ore so called by miners because it looked like copper but yielded none.  Meaning "coin made partly of nickel" is from 1857, when the U.S. introduced one-cent coins made of nickel to replace the old bulky copper pennies. Application to five-cent piece (originally one part nickel, three parts copper) is from 1883, Amer.Eng.; in earlier use were silver half-dimes.

Old English had ynne (in ynne-leac), from the same Latin source, which also produced Ir. inniun, Welsh wynwyn and similar words in Germanic. In Dutch, the ending in -n was mistaken for a plural inflection and new singular ui formed. The usual Indo-European name is represented by Gk. kromion, Ir. crem, Welsh craf, O.E. hramsa, Lith. kremuse. The usual Latin word was cepa, a loan from an unknown language; cf. O.Fr. cive, O.E. cipe, and, via L.L. dim. cepulla, It. cipolla, Sp. cebolla, Pol. cebula. Ger. Zwiebel also is from this source, but altered by folk etymology in Old High German (zwibolla) from words for "two" and "ball." Onion ring is attested from 1952.

From Gk. ostrakismos, from ostrakizein "to ostracize," from ostrakon "tile, potsherd," related to osteon "bone," ostreion "oyster" (and cognate with Ger. Estrich "pavement," from M.L. astracus "pavement," ult. from Gk. ostrakon).  A similar practice in ancient Syracuse (with banishment for five years) was by writing names on olive leaves, and thus was called petalismos. Figurative sense of "to exclude from society" is attested from 1640s.
ostracize	ˈɔstrəˌsaɪz	1640s, from Gk. ostrakizein (see ostracism). Related: Ostracization; ostracized; ostracizing.
ostrich	ˈɔstrɪtʃ	early 13c., from O.Fr. ostruce (Fr. autruche), from V.L. avis struthio, from L. avis "bird" (from PIE *awi- "bird") + L.L. struthio "ostrich," from Gk. strouthion "ostrich," from strouthos megale "big sparrow." The Greeks also knew the bird as strouthokamelos "camel-sparrow," for its long neck. Among its proverbial peculiarities are indiscriminate voracity (especially a habit of swallowing iron and stone to aid digestion), want of regard for its eggs, and a tendency to hide its head in the sand when pursued.Like the Austridge, who hiding her little head, supposeth her great body obscured. [1623]Ostriches do put their heads in the sand, but ostrich farmers say they do this in search of something to eat.

other-directed	ˈʌðədiˈrektid	O.E. beard "beard," from W.Gmc. *barthaz (cf. O.Fris. berd, M.Du. baert, O.H.G. bart, Ger. bart), seemingly from PIE *bhardh-a- "beard" (cf. O.C.S. brada, Lith. barzda, and perhaps L. barba "beard"). Pubic hair sense is from 1600s (but cf. neþir berd "pubic hair," late 14c.); in the 1811 "Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue," the phrase beard-splitter is defined as, "A man much given to wenching" (see beaver).  The Greek and Roman Churches have long disputed about the beard. While the Romanists have at different times practised shaving, the Greeks, on the contrary, have sternuously defended the cause of long beards. Leo III. (795 AD) was the first shaved Pope. Pope Gregory IV., after the lapse of only 30 years, fulminated a Bull against bearded priests. In the 12th century the prescription of the beard was extended to the laity. Pope Honorius III. to disguise his disfigured lip, allowed his beard to grow. Henry I. of England was so much moved by a sermon directed against his beard that he resigned it to the barber. Frederick Barbarossa is said to have been equally tractable. [Tom Robinson, M.D., "Beards," "St. James's Magazine," 1881]

Intended to mean "acidifying (principle)," from Fr. principe acidifiant. So called because oxygen was then considered essential in the formation of acids (it is now known not to be). The element was isolated by Priestley (1774), who, using the old model of chemistry, called it dephlogisticated air. The downfall of the phlogiston theory required a new name, which Lavoisier provided.

Sense of "to carry or convey in a pack" (1805) led to general sense of "to carry in any manner;" hence to pack heat "carry a gun," underworld slang from 1940s; "to be capable of delivering" (a punch, etc.) is from 1921. Related: Packed; packing.
package	ˈpækidʒ	1530s, "the act of packing," from pack (n.) + -age; or from cognate Du. pakkage "baggage." The main modern sense of "bundle, parcel" is first attested 1722. The verb is 1915, from the noun. Related: Packaged; packaging. Package deal is from 1952.

pad	pæd	1550s, "bundle of straw to lie on," possibly from Low Ger. or Flem. pad "sole of the foot." Meaning "cushion-like part of an animal foot" is from 1836 in English. Generalized sense of "something soft" is from c.1700; the sense of "a number of sheets fastened together" (in writing pad, drawing pad, etc.) is from 1865. Sense of "takeoff or landing place for a helicopter" is from 1960. The word persisted in underworld slang from early 18c. in the sense "sleeping place," and was popularized again c.1959, originally in beatnik speech (later hippie slang) in its original sense of "place to sleep temporarily." The verb meaning "to stuff, increase the amount of" is first recorded 1827, from the noun; transferred to expense accounts, etc. from 1913. Related: Padded; padding.

From stuffing and padding for clothes or upholstery, meaning extended to "pompous, empty speech" (1580s). Also from the same source are Swed. bomull, Dan. bomuld "cotton," and, via Turkish forms, Mod.Gk. mpampaki, Romanian bumbac, Serbo-Cr. pamuk.

Religious sense is often said to derive from conservative rural adherence to the old gods after the Christianization of Roman towns and cities; but the word in this sense predates that period in Church history, and it is more likely derived from the use of paganus in Roman military jargon for "civilian, incompetent soldier," which Christians (Tertullian, c.202; Augustine) picked up with the military imagery of the early Church (e.g. milites "soldier of Christ," etc.).

pathogenic	ˌpæθəˈdʒenɪk	"producing disease," 1852, from Fr. pathogénique, from Gk. pathos "disease" (see pathos) + Fr. génique "producing" (see -gen). Earlier pathogenetic (1838). Related: Pathogenicity.
pathological	ˌpæθəˈlɔdʒɪkəl	1680s, "pertaining to disease," formed in English from pathology. Sense of "worthy to be a subject of pathology, morbid, excessive" (e.g. pathological liar) is attested from 1845. Related: Pathologically.
pathology	pæˈθɔlədʒi:	"science of diseases," 1610s, from Fr. pathologie, from Mod.L. pathologia, from Gk. pathologikos "treating of disease," from pathos "suffering" (see pathos) + -logia "study" (see -logy).
pathos	ˈpeɪˌθɔs	"quality that arouses pity or sorrow," 1660s, from Gk. pathos "suffering, feeling, emotion," lit. "what befalls one," related to paskhein "to suffer," and penthos "grief, sorrow;" from PIE root *kwenth- "to suffer, endure" (cf. O.Ir. cessaim, Lith. kenciu "suffer").
patina	ˈpætnə	"greenish film on old bronze," 1748, from Fr. patine (18c.), from It. patina, perhaps from L. patina "dish, pan," on the notion of encrustation on ancient bronze dishes. Sense of "refinement, cultural sophistication" first recorded 1933.
patio	ˈpæti:ˌəʊ	1818, "inner court open to the sky," from Sp. patio probably from O.Prov. patu, pati "untilled land, communal pasture," from L. pactum "agreement" (see pact). Another theory traces the Sp. word to L. patere "to lie open." Meaning "paved and enclosed terrace beside a building" first recorded 1941. Patio furniture is attested from 1969.
patriarchal	ˌpeɪtri:ˈɑ:kəl	1560s, "pertaining to a (Church) patriarch,"  from L.L. patriarchalis (c.500), from patriarcha (see patriarch).
patriarchy	ˈpeɪtri:ˌɑ:ki:	1560s, in ecclesiastical sense, from Gk. patriarchia, from patriarches (see patriarch). Meaning "system of society or government by fathers or elder males of the community" first recorded 1630s.
patrician	pəˈtrɪʃən	early 15c., "member of the ancient Roman noble order," from M.Fr. patricien, from L. patricius "of the rank of the nobles, of the senators," from patres conscripti "Roman senators," lit. "fathers," plural of pater "father" (see father). Contrasted, in ancient Rome, with plebeius. Applied to noble citizens and higher orders of free folk in medieval It. and Ger. cities (sense attested in English from 1610s); hence "nobleman, aristocrat" in a modern sense (1630s). As an adjective, attested from 1610s, from the noun.
patrimony	ˈpætriməni	mid-14c., "property of the Church," also "spiritual legacy of Christ," from O.Fr. patrimonie (12c.), from L. patrimonium "a paternal estate, inheritance," from pater (gen. patris) "father" + -monium, suffix signifying action, state, condition. Meaning "property inherited from a father or ancestors" is attested from late 14c. Fig. sense of "immaterial things handed down from the past" is from 1580s. A curious sense contrast to matrimony.
patriot	ˈpeitriət	1590s, "compatriot," from M.Fr. patriote (15c.), from L.L. patriota "fellow-countryman" (6c.), from Gk. patriotes "fellow countryman," from patrios "of one's fathers," patris "fatherland," from pater (gen. patros) "father," with -otes, suffix expressing state or condition. Meaning "loyal and disinterested supporter of one's country" is attested from c.1600, but became an ironic term of ridicule or abuse from mid-18c. in England, so that Johnson, who at first defined it as "one whose ruling passion is the love of his country," in his fourth edition added, "It is sometimes used for a factious disturber of the government."The name of patriot had become [c.1744] a by-word of derision. Horace Walpole scarcely exaggerated when he said that ... the most popular declaration which a candidate could make on the hustings was that he had never been and never would be a patriot. [Macaulay, "Horace Walpole," 1833]Somewhat revived in reference to resistance movements in overrun countries in WWII, it has usually had a positive sense in Amer.Eng., where the phony and rascally variety has been consigned to the word patrioteer (1928). Oriana Fallaci ["The Rage and the Pride," 2002] marvels that Americans, so fond of patriotic, patriot, and patriotism, lack the root noun and are content to express the idea of patria by cumbersome compounds such as homeland. (Joyce, Shaw, and H.G. Wells all used patria as an English word early 20c., but it failed to stick.) Patriotsâ Day (April 19, anniversary of the 1775 skirmishes at Lexington and Concord Bridge) was observed as a legal holiday in Maine and Massachusetts from 1894.
patriotism	ˈpeɪtri:əˌtɪzəm	1726, from patriot + -ism.
patrol	pəˈtrəul	1660s, "action of going the rounds" (of a military camp, etc.), from Fr. patrouille "a night watch" (1530s), from patrouiller "go the rounds to watch or guard," originally "tramp through the mud," probably soldiers' slang, from O.Fr. patouiller "paddle in water," probably from pate "paw, foot" (see patois). Compare paddlefoot, World War II U.S. Army slang for "infantry soldier." Meaning "those who go on a patrol" is from 1660s. Sense of "detachment of soldiers sent out to scout the countryside, the enemy, etc." is attested from 1702. The verb first recorded 1690s. Related: Patrolled; patrolling.

Pea soup is first recorded 1711 (pease-soup); applied to London fogs since at least 1849. In Breton, piz, lit. "peas," also means "stingy," perhaps as a semantic borrowing of Fr. chiche "stingy," lit. "small," which also happens to be a homonym of chiche "peas."

Portuguese traders took peanuts from Brazil and Peru to Africa by 1502 and it is known to have been cultivated in Chekiang Province in China by 1573, probably arriving with Port. sailors who made stops in Brazil en route to the Orient. Peanut butter attested by 1892. Peanut gallery "topmost rows of a theater" is from 1888; peanuts "trivial sum" is from 1934.

pen	pen	"writing implement," c.1300, from O.Fr. penne "quill pen, feather," from L. penna "feather," from PIE *petna-, suffixed form of root *pet- "to rush, fly" (see petition). From the same root comes suffixed form *petra-, source of Skt. patram "wing, feather," Gk. pteron "wing," O.C.S. pero "pen," O.N. fjöðr, O.E. feðer (see feather).  In later French, this word means only "long feather of a bird," while the equivalent of English plume is used for "writing implement," the senses of the two words thus reversed from what they are in English.

[Cicero, "De Officiis"]    [Philosophical problems] are, of course, not empirical problems; but they are solved through an insight into the workings of our language, and that in such a way that these workings are recognized -- despite an urge to misunderstand them. The problems are solved, not through the contribution of new knowledge, rather through the arrangement of things long familiar. Philosophy is a struggle against the bewitchment (Verhexung) of our understanding by the resources of our language.

Edison in 1877) it is attested from 1878. The recording made from it at first was called a phonogram (1879).

Mistakenly applied in English 1640s to the colonnade of Covent Garden, designed by Inigo Jones, rather than to the marketplace itself; hence "the verandah of a house" (1724, chiefly Amer.Eng.).
picayunish	ˌpikəˈju:niʃ	 
pick	pik	early 13c., picken "to peck;" c.1300, piken "to work with a pick," probably representing a fusion of O.E. *pician "to prick," (implied by picung "a piercing, pricking," an 8c. gloss on L. stigmata) merged with O.N. pikka "to prick, peck," from a common Germanic root (cf. M.Du. picken, Ger. picken "to pick, peck"), perhaps imitative.

What [William] Perkins, and the whole Puritan movement after him, sought was to replace the personal pride of birth and status with the professional's or craftsman's pride of doing one's best in one's particular calling. The good Christian society needs the best of kings, magistrates, and citizens. Perkins most emphasized the work ethic from Genesis: "In the swaete of thy browe shalt thou eate thy breade." [E.

ragtime	ˈrægˌtaɪm	also rag-time, "syncopated, jazzy piano music," 1897, from rag "dance ball" (1895, Amer.Eng. dialect), possibly a shortening of ragged, in reference to the rhythmic imbalance.  If rag-time was called tempo di raga or rague-temps it might win honor more speedily. ... What the derivation of the word is[,] I have not the faintest idea.

ramshackle	ˈræmˌʃækəl	1809, back-formation from ramshackled, earlier ranshackled (1670s), alteration of ransackled, pp. of ransackle (see ransack). The word seems to have been regarded as Scottish.

I take it home willingly, as a Scotticism, and one well applied, as may be afterwards shown. [Robert Gourlay, "General Introduction to a Statistical Account of Upper Canada," London, 1822]  Jamieson's "Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language" (1825) has it as a noun meaning "thoughtless, ignorant fellow."

Skt. rte "besides, except," viralah "distant, tight, rare;" O.C.S. oriti "to dissolve, destroy;" Lith. irti "to dissolve;" O.C.S. rediku "rare;" Gk. eremos "solitary"). "Few in number," hence, "unusual" (1540s). In chemistry, rare earth is from 1818.
rarefaction	ˌrɛəriˈfækʃən	c.1600, noun of action from L. rarefacere (see rarefy).
rarely	ˈrɛəli	from rare (adj.1) + -ly (2).
rascal	ˈræskəl	early 14c., rascaile "people of the lowest class, rabble of an army," from O.Fr. rascaille "outcast, rabble" (12c.), perhaps from rasque "mud, filth, scab, dregs," from V.L. *rasicare "to scrape" (see rash (n.)).  The singular form is first attested mid-15c.; extended sense of "low, dishonest person" is from 1580s.
rash	ræʃ	"thin slice of bacon or ham," 1590s, of unknown origin. Perhaps from Middle English rash "to cut," variant of rase "to rub, scrape out, erase," from O.Fr. raser (see raze). However, early lexicographer John Minsheu explained it in 1627 as a piece "rashly or hastily roasted."
rashly	ˈræʃlɪ	"thin slice of bacon or ham," 1590s, of unknown origin. Perhaps from Middle English rash "to cut," variant of rase "to rub, scrape out, erase," from O.Fr. raser (see raze). However, early lexicographer John Minsheu explained it in 1627 as a piece "rashly or hastily roasted."

raspy	ˈrɑ:spi	1670s, of plants; by 1821 of voices, from rasp + -y (2).
rat	ræt	O.E. ræt, of uncertain origin. Similar words are found in Celtic (Gael. radan), Romanic (It. ratto, Sp. rata, Fr. rat) and Germanic (M.L.G. rotte, Ger. ratte) languages, but connection is uncertain and origin unknown. Perhaps from V.L. *rattus, but Weekley thinks this is of Germanic origin, "the animal having come from the East with the race-migrations" and the word passing thence to the Romanic languages. American Heritage and Tucker connect O.E. ræt to L. rodere and thus PIE *red- "to scrape, scratch, gnaw," source of rodent (q.v.). Klein says there is no connection and suggests a possible cognate in Gk. rhine "file, rasp." Weekley connects them with a question mark and Barnhart writes, "the relationship to each other of the Germanic, Romance, and Celtic words for rat is uncertain." OED says "probable" the rat word spread from Germanic to Romanic, but takes no position on ultimate origin.  Middle English common form was ratton, from augmented O.Fr. form raton. Sense of "one who abandons his associates" (1620s) is from belief that rats leave a ship about to sink or a house about to fall and led to meaning "traitor, informant" (1902; verb 1910). Interjection rats is Amer.Eng., 1886. To smell a rat is c.1550. _____-rat, "person who frequents _____" (in earliest reference dock-rat) is from 1864. Rat-pack "juvenile gang" is from 1951.

Meaning "degree of speed" (prop. ratio between distance and time) is attested from 1650s. Currency exchange sense first recorded 1727. The verb "to estimate the worth or value of" is from 1590s. First-rate, second-rate, etc. are 1640s, from British Navy division of ships into six classes based on size and strength. Phrase at any rate originally (1610s) meant "at any cost;" weakened sense of "at least" is attested by 1760.

rating	ˈreitiŋ	action of verb "to rate" 1530s, from rate (n.). Ratings of TV programs, originally radio programs, began 1930 in U.S. under system set up by U.S. pollster and market researcher Archibald M. Crossley (1896-1985), and were called Crossley ratings or Crossleys until ratings began to be preferred c.1947.

The identical (in form) verb meaning "to wander, stray, rove" first appeared c.1300 in Scottish and northern dialect, and is probably from an unrelated Scandinavian word (cf. Icelandic rafa). Sense of "talk enthusiastically about" first recorded 1704. Noun meaning "rowdy party" is from 1960, though rave-up was British slang for "wild party" from 1940; specific modern sense of "mass party with loud, fast electronic music and often psychedelic drugs" is from 1989. Raver, from this sense, is first recorded 1991.
ravel	ˈrævəl	1580s, "to untangle, unwind," also "to become tangled or confused," from Du. ravelen "to tangle, fray, unweave," from rafel "frayed thread." The seemingly contradictory senses of this word (ravel and unravel are both synonyms and antonyms) are reconciled by its roots in weaving and sewing: as threads become unwoven, they get tangled.
ravening	ˈrævniŋ	1520s, the surviving prp. of an extinct verb raven "to prey, to plunder" (late 14c., implied in ravener), from O.Fr. raviner (see ravenous), and is not etymologically related to raven (n.).

razzle	ˈræzl	1886, Amer.Eng. slang, varied reduplication of dazzle (q.v.).  My confrère, The Chevalier, last month gave a new name to the scarfs of disjointed pattern when he called them the razzle-dazzle. The name was evidently a hit of the most patent character, for in several avenue and Broadway stores the clerks have thrown out a display of broken figures before me and explained that the ruling style at present was the razzle-dazzle, and the word seems to have been equally effective with the public, for when it is quoted by the live salesman, the customer, I am told is at once interested and caught by it. ["Clothier and Furnisher" magazine, Jan. 1889]

relieved	rɪˈli:vd	from the title of Joseph Heller's 1961 novel. In widespread use only after release of movie based on the book in 1970. The "catch" is that a bomber pilot is insane if he flies combat missions without asking to be relieved from duty, and is thus eligible to be relieved from duty. But if he asks to be relieved from duty, that means he's sane and has to keep flying. There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. "That's some catch, that Catch-22," he observed."It's the best there is," Doc Daneeka agreed. See catch (n.).
religion	riˈlidʒən	c.1200, "state of life bound by monastic vows," also "conduct indicating a belief in a divine power," from Anglo-Fr. religiun (11c.), from O.Fr. religion "religious community," from L. religionem (nom. religio) "respect for what is sacred, reverence for the gods," in L.L. "monastic life" (5c.); according to Cicero, derived from relegere "go through again, read again," from re- "again" + legere "read" (see lecture). However, popular etymology among the later ancients (and many modern writers) connects it with religare "to bind fast" (see rely), via notion of "place an obligation on," or "bond between humans and gods." Another possible origin is religiens "careful," opposite of negligens. Meaning "particular system of faith" is recorded from c.1300.To hold, therefore, that there is no difference in matters of religion between forms that are unlike each other, and even contrary to each other, most clearly leads in the end to the rejection of all religion in both theory and practice. And this is the same thing as atheism, however it may differ from it in name.

We fail to find the term mentioned by our lexicographers, but understand it to be a modern provincialism, probably emanating from the daily press, and used when referring to the corrupt application of money in the accomplishment of certain ends.

In French, the sense of "deliberately and maliciously destroying property" originally was in reference to labor disputes, but the oft-repeated story that the modern meaning derives from strikers' supposed tactic of throwing old shoes into machinery is not supported by the etymology. Likely it was not meant as a literal image; the word was used in French in a variety of "bungling" senses, such as "to play a piece of music badly."

sanguine	ˈsæŋgwɪn	early 14c., "type of red cloth," from O.Fr. sanguin (fem. sanguine), from L. sanguineus "of blood," also "bloody, bloodthirsty," from sanguis (gen. sanguinis) "blood" (see sanguinary). Meaning "blood-red" is recorded from late 14c. Meaning "cheerful, hopeful, confident" first attested c.1500, since these qualities were thought in medieval physiology to spring from an excess of blood as one of the four humors.

sapient	ˈseɪpi:ənt	"wise," late 15c., from O.Fr. sapient, from L. sapientem (nom. sapiens), prp. of sapere "to taste, have taste, be wise," from PIE root *sep- "to taste, perceive" (cf. O.S. an-sebban "to perceive, remark," O.H.G. antseffen, O.E. sefa "mind, understanding, insight;" see sap (n.1)).
sapless	ˈsæplɪs	 
sapling	ˈsæplɪŋ	early 15c., from sap (n.1) + dim. suffix -ling. This is probably the source of Amer.Eng. slang sap "club, short staff" (1899) and the verb sap "to hit (someone) with a sap" (1926).
sapphire	ˈsæfˌaɪə	late 13c., from O.Fr. saphir (12c.), from L. sapphirus (cf. Sp. zafir, It. zaffiro), from Gk. sappheiros "blue stone" (the gem meant apparently was not the one that now has the name, but perhaps rather "lapis lazuli," the modern sapphire perhaps signified by Gk. hyakinthos), from a Semitic source (cf. Heb. sappir "sapphire"), but probably not ult. from Semitic; some linguists propose an origin in Skt. sanipriya, a dark precious stone (perhaps sapphire or emerald), lit.

sardonic	sɑ:ˈdɔnɪk	1630s, from Fr. sardonique (16c.), from L. sardonius (but as if from L. *sardonicus) in Sardonius risus, loan-translation of Gk. sardonios (gelos) "of bitter or scornful (laughter)," altered from Homeric sardanios (of uncertain origin) by influence of Sardonios "Sardinian," because the Greeks believed that eating a certain plant they called sardonion (lit. "plant from Sardinia," see Sardinia) caused facial convulsions resembling those of sardonic laughter, usually followed by death. For nuances of usage, see humor. Related: Sardonically.
sartorial	sɑ:ˈtɔ:ri:əl	"pertaining to a tailor," 1823, from Mod.L. sartorius, from L.L. sartor "tailor," lit. "patcher, mender," from L. sart-, pp. stem of sarcire "to patch, mend."

satiny	ˈsætni:	 
satire	'sætaiə	late 14c., "work intended to ridicule vice or folly," from L. satira "satire, poetic medley," earlier satura, in lanx satura "mixed dish, dish filled with various kinds of fruit," lit. "full dish," from fem. of satur "sated" (see saturate). First applied in literary sense to a collection of poems on a variety of subjects by Ennius. In classical Latin, a poem which assailed the prevailing vices, one after another. Altered in Latin by influence of Gk. satyr, on mistaken notion that the form is related to the Greek satyr drama (see satyr).Satire, n. An obsolete kind of literary composition in which the vices and follies of the author's enemies were expounded with imperfect tenderness. In this country satire never had more than a sickly and uncertain existence, for the soul of it is wit, wherein we are dolefully deficient, the humor that we mistake for it, like all humor, being tolerant and sympathetic. Moreover, although Americans are 'endowed by their Creator' with abundant vice and folly, it is not generally known that these are reprehensible qualities, wherefore the satirist is popularly regarded as a sour-spirited knave, and his every victim's outcry for codefendants evokes a national assent. [Ambrose Bierce, "Devil's Dictionary," 1911]    Proper satire is distinguished, by the generality of the reflections, from a lampoon which is aimed against a particular person, but they are too frequently confounded. [Johnson]    [I]n whatever department of human expression, wherever there is objective truth there is satire [Wyndham Lewis, "Rude Assignment," 1950]  For nuances of usage, see humor.

Saturn	ˈsætən	"gloomy, morose, sluggish, grave," mid-15c., lit. "born under the influence of the planet Saturn," from M.E. Saturne (see Saturn). Medieval physiology believed these characteristics to be caused by the astrological influence of the planet Saturn, which was the most remote from the Sun (in the limited knowledge of the times) and thus coldest and slowest in its revolution.
saturnalia	ˌsætəˈneɪli:ə	"time of merrymaking," 1590s, from L. Saturnalia, ancient Roman festival of Saturn (held in December), a time of merrymaking for all, from neuter plural of adjective Saturnalis "pertaining to Saturn," from Saturnus (see Saturn).

Medieval physiology believed these characteristics to be caused by the astrological influence of the planet Saturn, which was the most remote from the Sun (in the limited knowledge of the times) and thus coldest and slowest in its revolution.
satyr	ˈsætə	"excessively great venereal desire in the male," 1650s, medical Latin, from Gk. satyriasis, from satyros (see satyr).
sauce	sɔ:s	mid-14c., from O.Fr. saucier "sauce dish," from L.L. salsarium, neuter of salsarius "of or for salted things," from L. salsus (see sauce). Meaning "small, round, shallow vessel for supporting a cup" is attested from c.1702.
saucy	ˈsɔ:si:	c.1500, "resembling sauce," later "impertinent, cheeky" (1520s), from sauce (q.v.). The connecting notion is the figurative sense of "piquancy in words or actions." Cf. sauce malapert "impertinence" (1520s), and slang phrase to have eaten sauce "be abusive" (1520s). Also cf. salty in same senses.
saunter	ˈsɔ:ntə	"a leisurely stroll," 1828, from saunter (v.).
savage	ˈsævidʒ	c.1300, "wild, undomesticated, untamed" (of animals and places), from O.Fr. sauvage, salvage "wild, savage, untamed," from L.L. salvaticus, alteration of silvaticus "wild," lit.

savor	ˈseivə	"pleasing in taste or smell," early 13c., from O.Fr. savoure (Fr. savoré),  pp. of savourer "to taste" (see savor).
savory	ˈseɪvəri:	"aromatic mint," late 14c., perhaps an alteration of O.E. sæþerie, which is ultimately from L. satureia "savory (n.)." But early history of the word suggests transmission via O.Fr. savereie. In either case, the form of the word probably altered by influence of the M.E. or O.Fr. form of savory (adj.).
savvy	ˈsævi	1785, as a noun, "practical sense, intelligence;" also a verb, "to know, to understand;" West Indies pidgin borrowing of Fr. savez(-vous)? "do you know?" or Sp. sabe (usted) "you know," both from V.L. *sapere, from L. sapere "be wise, be knowing" (see sapient). The adj. is first recorded 1905, from the noun. Related: Savviness.

O.S. seggian, O.N. segja, O.Fris. sedsa, M.Du. segghen, Du. zeggen, O.H.G. sagen, Ger. sagen "to say"), from PIE *sokei-, probably from root *seq- "point out" (cf. Hitt. shakiya- "to declare," Lith. sakyti "to say," O.C.S. sociti "to vindicate, show," O.Ir. insce "speech," O.Latin inseque "to tell say").  Past tense said developed from O.E. segde. Not attested in use with inanimate objects (clocks, signs, etc.) as subjects before 1930. You said it "you're right" first recorded 1919; you can say that again as a phrase expressing agreement is recorded from 1942, Amer.Eng. You don't say (so) as an expression of astonishment (often ironic) is first recorded 1779, Amer.Eng.
scab	skæb	mid-13c., "skin disease," developed from O.E. sceabb "scab, itch" (related to scafan "to scratch") and from O.N. skabb "scab, itch," both from P.Gmc. *skab- "scratch, shave" (related to shabby). Sense reinforced by cognate L. scabies "scab, itch, mange" (from scabere "to scratch;" see scabies). Meaning "crust which forms over a wound or sore" is first attested c.1400. Meaning "strikebreaker" first recorded 1806, from earlier sense of "person who refuses to join a trade union" (1777), probably from meaning "despicable person" (1580s), possibly borrowed in this sense from M.Du.

scaffold	ˈskæfəld	mid-14c. (implied in scaffolding), aphetic of an O.N.Fr. variant of O.Fr. eschafaut "scaffold," probably altered (by influence of eschace "a prop, support") from chaffaut, from V.L. *catafalicum (see catafalque).
scald	skɔ:ld	early 13c., from O.N.Fr. escalder (O.Fr. eschalder, Fr. échauder) "to scald," from L.L. excaldare "bathe in hot water," from L. ex- "off" + calidus "hot" (see calorie).
scalding	ˈskɔ:ldɪŋ

The connecting sense seems to be of half of a bivalve ("split") shell used as a drinking cup or a pan for weighing. But according to Paulus Diaconus the "drinking cup" sense originated from a supposed custom of making goblets from skulls (see skull).

scalp	skælp	c.1300, presumably from a Scandinavian source (though exact cognates are wanting) related to O.N. skalli "bald head," skalpr "sheath," from the source of scale (n.2). Fr. scalpe, Ger., Swed. skalp are from English. The verb meaning "to cut off (someone's) scalp" is recorded from 1670s, originally in reference to N.Amer. Indians. Related: Scalped; scalping.
scalpel	ˈskælpəl	1742, from L. scalpellum, dim. of scalprum "knife, chisel, tool for scraping or cutting," from scalpere "to carve, cut," related to sculpere "to carve," from PIE root *(s)kel- "to cut, cleave."
scamp	skæmp	1782, "highway robber," probably from dialectal verb scamp "to roam" (1753), shortened from scamper. Used affectionately in sense "rascal" since 1808.
scamper	ˈskæmpə	"to run quickly," 1680s, probably from Flem. schampeeren, frequentative of schampen "run away," from O.N.Fr. escamper (O.Fr. eschamper) "to run away, flee," from V.L. *excampare "decamp," lit. "leave the field," from L. ex campo, from ex "out of" + campo, ablative of campus "field" (see campus). A vogue word late 17c. Related: Scampered; scampering.

Skt. skandati "hastens, leaps, jumps;" Gk. skandalon "stumbling block;" M.Ir. sescaind "he sprang, jumped," sceinm "a bound, jump"). Missing -d in English is probably from confusion with suffix -ed (see lawn (1)). Sense of "look at closely, examine" first recorded 1540s. The (opposite) sense of "look over quickly, skim" is first attested 1926. The noun is recorded from 1706.

scapegoat	ˈskeɪpˌgəʊt	1530, "goat sent into the wilderness on the Day of Atonement, symbolic bearer of the sins of the people," coined by Tyndale from scape (n.) + goat to translate L. caper emissarius, itself a translation in Vulgate of Hebrew 'azazel (Lev. xvi:8,10,26), which was read as 'ez ozel "goat that departs," but which others hold to be the proper name of a devil or demon in Jewish mythology (sometimes identified with Canaanite deity Aziz). Jerome's reading also was followed by Martin Luther (der ledige Bock), Symmachus (tragos aperkhomenos), and others (cf. Fr. bouc émissaire), but the question of who, or what (or even where) is meant by 'azazel is a vexed one. The Revised Version (1884) simply restores Azazel. But the old translation has its modern defenders:  Azazel is an active participle or participial noun, derived ultimately from azal (connected with the Arabic word azala, and meaning removed), but immediately from the reduplicate form of that verb, azazal. The reduplication of the consonants of the root in Hebrew and Arabic gives the force of repetition, so that while azal means removed, azalzal means removed by a repetition of acts. Azalzel or azazel, therefore, means one who removes by a series of acts. ... The interpretation is founded on sound etymological grounds, it suits the context wherever the word occurs, it is consistent with the remaining ceremonial of the Day of Atonement, and it accords with the otherwise known religious beliefs and symbolical practices of the Israelites. [Rev. F. Meyrick, "Leviticus," London, 1882]  Meaning "one who is blamed or punished for the mistakes or sins of others" first recorded 1824; the verb is attested from 1943.
scar	skɑ:	1540s, "cover witch scratches," from Fr. scarifier (14c.), from L.L. scarificare (see scarification). The sense "cover with scars" (1680s) is a sense-shift from influence of scar.
scarce	skɛəs	c.1300, "restricted in quantity," from O.N.Fr. scars (O.Fr. eschars) from V.L. *escarpsus, from *excarpere "pluck out," from L. excerpere "pluck out" (see excerpt). Phrase to make oneself scarce "go away" first attested 1809 in "Gil Blas." Related: Scarcely.
scarcely	ˈskɛəsli	early 15c., from M.Fr. pénurie, from L. penuria "want, need," related to paene "scarcely."

Or perhaps from a dial. survival of O.E. sceorfan "to gnaw, bite" (see scarf (2)); a similar word is found in a S.African context in the 1600s.
scarp	skɑ:p	"steep slope," 1580s, from It. scarpa "slope," probably from a Germanic source, perhaps Goth. *skrapa (cf. M.H.G. schroffe "sharp rock, crag," O.E. scræf "cave, grave").
scathe	skeɪð	c.1200, from O.N. skaða "to hurt, injure," from P.Gmc. *skath- (cf. O.E. sceaþian "to hurt, injure," O.Fris. skethia, M.Du. scaden, Du. schaden, O.H.G. scadon, Ger. schaden, Goth. scaþjan "to injure, damage"), from PIE root *sket- "to injure." Only cognate outside Germanic seems to be in Gk. a-skethes "unharmed, unscathed." Survives mostly in its negative form, unscathed, and in figurative meaning "sear with invective or satire" (1852, usually as scathing) which developed from the sense of "scar, scorch" used by Milton in "Paradise Lost" i.613 (1667). Related: Scathingly.
scathing	ˈskeɪðɪŋ	c.1200, from O.N. skaða "to hurt, injure," from P.Gmc. *skath- (cf.

sceptre	ˈseptə	c.1300, from O.Fr. sceptre, from L. sceptrum, from Gk. skeptron "staff," from root of skeptesthai "to prop oneself." Cognate with O.E. sceaft (see shaft).

"cutting instrument," from *cisus (in compounds such as L. excisus, pp. of excidere "to cut out"), ultimately from L. caedere "to cut" (see -cide). Spelling with sc- is 16c., from influence of M.L. scissor "tailor," from L. "carver, cutter," from pp. stem of scindere "to split." Usually with pair of (attested from c.1400) when indication of just one is required, but a sing. form without the -s was occasionally used (mid-15c., cysowre).

scold	skəuld	mid-12c., "person of ribald speech," also "person fond of abusive language," from O.N. skald "poet" (see skald).

The connecting notion is perhaps counting large numbers (of sheep, etc.) with a notch in a stick for each 20. This counting notion is the origin of the modern sense in sports (1742, originally in whist). In O.Fr., "twenty" (vint) or a multiple of it could be used as a base, e.g. vint et doze ("32"), dous vinz et diz ("50").

As a noun, elliptical for Scotch whisky, it is attested from 1778. Scotch-Irish is from 1876; more properly Scots-Irish (1972), from Scots (mid-14c.), the older adj., which is from Scottis, the northern variant of Scottish.

sin	sin	O.E. synn "moral wrongdoing, offense against God, misdeed," from P.Gmc. *sundjo (cf. O.S. sundia, O.Fris. sende, M.Du. sonde, Ger. Sünde "sin, transgression, trespass, offense"), probably ultimately "true" (cf. Goth. sonjis, O.N. sannr "true"), from PIE *es-ont-, prp. of root *es- "to be" (see is). The semantic development is via notion of "to be truly the one (who is guilty)," as in O.N. phrase verð sannr at "be found guilty of," and the use of the phrase "it is being" in Hittite confessional formula. The same process probably yielded the Latin word sons (gen. sontis) "guilty, criminal" from prp. of sum, esse "to be, that which is." Some etymologists believe the Germanic word was an early borrowing directly from the Latin genitive. Sin-eater is attested from 1680s. To live in sin "cohabit without marriage" is from 1838. Ice hockey slang sin bin "penalty box" is attested from 1950.
sincere	sinˈsiə	1530s, from M.Fr. sincere, from L. sincerus (see sincerity). There is no etymological justification for the common story that the word means "without wax" (*sin cerae), and the stories invented to explain that folk etymology are even less plausible.
sinecure	ˈsaɪnɪˌkjʊə	1660s, "church benefice without parish duties," from M.L. beneficium sine cura "benefice without care" (of souls), from L. sine "without" + cura, ablative singular of cura "care" (see cure).
sinew	ˈsɪnju:	O.E. seonowe, oblique form of nom. sionu "sinew," from P.Gmc. *senawo (cf. O.S. sinewa, O.N. sina, O.Fris. sine, M.Du. senuwe, O.H.G. senawa, Ger. Sehne), from PIE root *sai- "to bend" (cf. Skt. snavah "sinew," Avestan snavar, Ir. sin "chain").
sinewy	ˈsɪnju:i:	late 14c., from sinew + -y (2).
singe	sɪndʒ	O.E. sengan "to burn lightly, burn the edges" (of hair, wings, etc.), from P.Gmc. *sangjanan (cf. O.Fris. of-sendza, M.Du. singhen, Du. zengen, Ger. sengen "to singe"). The root often is said to be related to that of sing, on the idea of some sort of sound produced by singeing.

sinister	ˈsinistə	early 15c., "prompted by malice or ill-will," from O.Fr. sinistre "contrary, unfavorable, to the left," from L. sinister "left, on the left side" (opposite of dexter), perhaps from root *sen- and meaning properly "the slower or weaker hand" [Tucker], but Buck suggests it's a euphemism (see left), connected with the root of Skt. saniyan "more useful, more advantageous." The Latin word was used in augury in the sense of "unlucky, unfavorable" (omens, especially bird flights, seen on the left hand were regarded as portending misfortune), and thus sinister acquired a sense of "harmful, unfavorable, adverse." This was from Greek influence, reflecting the early Greek practice of facing north when observing omens; in genuine Roman auspices, the left was favorable. Bend (not "bar") sinister in heraldry indicates illegitimacy and preserves the lit. sense of "on the left side."
sink	siŋk	early 15c., "pool or pit for wastewater or sewage," from sink (v.). Sense of "shallow basin with drainpipe" first recorded 1560s.

Greek revival and is preferred in U.S.Skeptic does not mean him who doubts, but him who investigates or researches as opposed to him who asserts and thinks that he has found.

First element apparently unconnected with skew (v.); OED suggests perhaps from O.Fr. escu "shield," but also notes a close resemblance in form and sense with Icel. skjottr, "the history of which is equally obscure." When the white is mixed with black it is called 'pie-bald,' with bay the name of 'skew-bald' is given to it. ["Youatt's 'The Horse,' " 1866] 
skewer	ˈskju:ə	1670s, variant of skiver (1660s), perhaps from O.N. skifa "disk, cut, slice," related to shiver (n.). The verb is attested from 1701, from the noun. Related: Skewered; skewering.

O.H.G. scum "scum," Ger. Schaum; see scum). Hence, skim milk (1590s), from which the cream has been skimmed. Meaning "to glance over carelessly" (in ref. to printed matter) first recorded 1799; that of "to move over lightly and rapidly" is from 1690s. Skimmer, the N.Amer. shore bird (1785), so called from its method of feeding.

But early prominence in southwestern texts suggests rather origin from a Dutch or Low Ger. cognate (e.g. Du. schol "turf, piece of ice," but the sense of "head bone framework" is wanting).

slack	slæk	O.E. slæc "loose, careless" (in reference to personal conduct), from P.Gmc. *slakas (cf.

spouse	spauz	c.1200, "a married woman in relation to her husband" (also of men), from O.Fr. spus (fem. spuse), from L. sponsus "bridegroom" (fem. sponsa "bride"), from masc. and fem. pp. of spondere "to bind oneself, promise solemnly," from PIE *spend- "to make an offering, perform a rite" (see spondee). Spouse-breach (early 13c.) was an old name for "adultery."
spout	spaʊt	early 14c., related to M.Du. spoiten "to spout," N.Fris. spütji "spout, squirt," Swed. sputa "to spout," and probably M.Du. spuwen "to spit" (see spew). Meaning "to talk, declaim" is recorded from 1610s. The noun is first recorded late 14c. It was the slang term for the lift in a pawnbroker's shop, up which articles were taken for storage, hence fig. phrase up the spout "lost, hopeless, gone beyond recall" (1812).
sprain	spreɪn	c.1600, of uncertain origin. The verb is attested from 1620s. A connection has been suggested to M.Fr. espraindre "to press out," from L. exprimere, but the sense evolution is difficult.

From spring (v.); also see spring (n.3). The notion is of the "spring of the year," when plants "spring up" (cf. spring of the leaf, 1530s).  Other Germanic languages tend to take words for "fore" or "early" as their roots for the season name, cf. Dan. voraar, Du. voorjaar, lit. "fore-year;" Ger. Frühling, from M.H.G. vrueje "early."

O.S. sprutan, O.Fris. spruta, M.Du. spruten, O.H.G. spriozan, Ger. spreissen "to sprout"), from PIE root *sper- "to strew" (cf. Gk. speirein "to scatter," spora "a scattering, sowing," sperma "sperm, seed," lit.

squander	ˈskwɔndə	1580s (implied in squandering), "to spend recklessly or prodigiously," of unknown origin; Shakespeare used it 1593 in "Merchant of Venice" with a sense of "to be scattered over a wide area." Squander-bug, a British symbol of reckless extravagance and waste during war-time shortages, represented as a devilish insect, was introduced January 1943 by the National Savings Committee. In U.S., Louis Ludlow coined squanderlust (1935) for the tendency of government bureaucracies to spend much money.
square	skwɛə	c.1300, "containing four equal sides and right angles," from square (n.). Meaning "honest, fair," is first attested 1560s; that of "straight, direct" is from 1804.

O.N. stallr "pedestal for idols, altar," O.Fris. stal, O.H.G. stall "stand, place, stable, stall," Ger. Stall "stable," Stelle "place"), earlier *stalnaz- or *stathlo-, from PIE root *stel- "to put, stand," with derivatives referring to a standing object or place (cf. Gk. stele "standing block, slab," L. stolidus "insensible, dull, brutish," properly "unmovable").  The word passed into Romanic languages (cf. It. stallo "place," stalla "stable;" O.Fr. estal "place, position, stand, stall," Fr. étal "butcher's stall"). Several meanings, including that of "a stand for selling" (mid-13c., implied in stallage "tax levied for the privilege of erecting a stall at a market or fair"), are from (or influenced by) O.Fr. estal.

stammer	ˈstæmə	O.E. stamerian, from W.Gmc. *stamrojan (cf. O.N. stammr, O.H.G. stam, Goth. stamms "stammering," M.Du. stameren, Ger. stammeln "to stammer," O.Fris., Ger. stumm "dumb"), from PIE root *stam-, *stum- "check, impede" (see stem (v.)).
stamp	stæmp	O.E. stempan "to pound in a mortar, stamp," from P.Gmc. *stampojanan (cf. O.N. stappa, M.Du. stampen, O.H.G. stampfon, Ger. stampfen "to stamp with the foot, beat, pound," Ger.

Stamping ground "one's particular territory" (1821) is from the notion of animals. It. stampa "stamp, impression," Sp. estampar "to stamp, print," Fr. estamper "to stamp, impress" are Germanic loan-words.
stampede	stæmˈpi:d	1828, from Mex.Sp. estampida, from Sp., "an uproar," from estamper "to stamp, press, pound," from the same Germanic root that yielded English stamp (v.). The verb is from 1823.

standard	ˈstændəd	mid-12c., "flag or other conspicuous object to serve as a rallying point for a military force," from O.Fr. estandart, probably from Frank. *standhard, lit. "stand fast or firm," a compound of words similar to Gothic standan "to stand" (see stand) and hardus "hard" (see hard). So called because the flag was fixed to a pole or spear and stuck in the ground to stand upright. The other theory connects the O.Fr. word to estendre "to stretch out," from L. extendere (see extend). Meaning "unit of measure" is early 14c., from Anglo-Fr., where it was used 13c., and is perhaps metaphoric, the royal standard coming to stand for royal authority in matters like setting weights and measures. Hence the meaning "authoritative or recognized exemplar of quality or correctness" (late 15c.). Meaning "rule, principal or means of judgment" is from 1560s. That of "definite level of attainment" is attested from 1711 (e.g. standard of living, 1903). Some senses (e.g. "upright pole," mid-15c.) seem to be influenced by stand (v.).

So called because the bacteria usually bunch together in irregular masses.
staple	ˈsteipl	"principal article grown or made in a country or district," early 15c., "official market for some class of merchandise," from Anglo-Fr. (14c.), from O.Fr. estaple "market," from a Germanic source akin to M.L.G. stapol, M.Du. stapel "market," from the same source as staple (1), the notion being of market stalls behind pillars of an arcade, or else of a raised platform where the king's deputies administered judgment.

stonewall	ˈstəʊnˌwɔ:l	O.E. stanwalle (n.); see stone (n.) + wall. As nickname of Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson (1824-1863), bestowed 1861 on the occasion of the First Battle of Bull Run, supposedly by Gen. Bernard Bee, urging his brigade to rally around Jackson, who was âstanding like a stone wall.â Bee was killed in the battle; the account of the nickname appeared in Southern newspapers within four days of the battle.  On the face of it this account has no character of authenticity, and the words ascribed to Bee smack less of the battlefield than of the editorial sanctum. ... It seems inherently probable that something was said by somebody, during or immediately after the battle, that likened Jackson or his men or both to a stone wall. [R.M. Johnston, âBull Run: Its Strategy and Tactics,â Boston, 1913]   As a verb, "to obstruct," 1914, from metaphoric use of stone wall for "act of obstruction" (1876).

The word then was applied to "a low decorative facade above the main story of a building" (1690s in English), and it came to mean the space enclosed by such a structure. The modern use is via French. attique. "An attic is upright, a garret is in a sloping roof" [Weekley].

sweep	swi:p	c.1300, perhaps from a past tense form of M.E. swope "sweep," from O.E. swapan "to sweep" (transitive & intransitive); see swoop. The noun meaning "range, extent" is attested from 1679; in ref. to police or military actions, it is attested from 1837. Sense of "a winning of all the tricks in a card game" is from 1814 (see sweepstakes); extended to other sports by 1960. As a shortened form of  chimney-sweeper, first attested 1812.
swell	swel	early 13c., "a morbid swelling," from swell (v.). In ref. to a rise of the sea, it is attested from c.1600. The meaning "wealthy, elegant person" is first recorded 1786; hence the adj. meaning "fashionably dressed or equipped" (1810), both from the notion of "puffed-up, pompous" behavior.

swerve	swə:v	early 13c., "to depart, make off;" early 14c., "to turn aside, deviate from a straight course," probably from O.E. sweorfan "to rub, scour, file" (but sense development is difficult to trace), from P.Gmc. *swerbanan (cf O.N. sverfa "to scour, file," O.S. swebran "to wipe off"), from PIE root *swerbh-. Cognate words in other Germanic languages (cf. O.Fris. swerva "to creep," M.Du. swerven "to rove, stray") suggests the sense of "go off, turn aside" may have existed in O.E., though unrecorded. The noun is recorded from 1741.
swift	swift	O.E. swift "moving quickly," related to swifan "move in a course, sweep" (see swivel). The bird (several species of the family Cypselidæ, resembling swallows), noted for its "swift" flight, was so called from at least 1660s. Regarded as a bird of ill-omen, if not downright demonic, probably for its shrill cry. The name earlier had been given to several small fast lizards (1520s).

Schwein), neuter adjective (with suffix *-ino-) from PIE *su- (see sow (n.)). The native word, largely ousted by pig. Applied to persons from late 14c. Phrase pearls before swine is from Matt. vii:6; an early English formation of it was: Ne ge ne wurpen eowre meregrotu toforan eo wrum swynon. [c.1000]  The Latin word was confused in French with marguerite "daisy" (the "pearl" of the field), and in Dutch the expression became "roses before swine."

swipe	swaɪp	1807, "a driving stroke made with the arms in full swing," perhaps a dialectal variant of sweep, or in part from obsolete swip "a stroke, blow" (c.1200), from P.Gmc. *swip-, related to O.E. swipu "a stick, whip." Other possible sources or influences are M.E. swope "to sweep with broad movements" (in ref. to brooms, swords, etc.), from O.E. swapan; obsolete swaip "stroke, blow;" or obsolete swape "oar, pole." The verb is from 1825. The slang sense of "steal, pilfer" appeared 1889, Amer.Eng., said originally to be theatrical jargon for performers stealing jokes or stage routines from one another. Meaning "run a credit card" is 1990s.

Meaning "pounce upon with a sweeping movement" first recorded 1630s. Spelling with -oo- may have been influenced by Scottish and northern England dialectal soop "to sweep," from O.N. sopa "to sweep." Related: Swooped; swooping. The noun is attested from 1540s. Phrase one fell swoop is from Shakespeare.  Oh, Hell-Kite! All? What, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme, At one fell swoope?

Spelling with -y- influenced by Gk. hyle "forest," from which the Latin word was supposed to derive.

talebearer	ˈteɪlˌbeərə	1530s (in L. form sycophanta), "informer, talebearer, slanderer," from L. sycophanta, from Gk. sykophantes, originally "one who shows the fig," from sykon "fig" + phanein "to show." "Showing the fig" was a vulgar gesture made by sticking the thumb between two fingers, a display which vaguely resembles a fig, itself symbolic of a cunt (sykon also meant "vulva"). The story goes that prominent politicians in ancient Greece held aloof from such inflammatory gestures, but privately urged their followers to taunt their opponents. The sense of "mean, servile flatterer" is first recorded in English 1570s.

Meaning "small country residence" (without suggestion of poverty or tenancy) is from 1765. Mod.Fr. cottage is a 19c. reborrowing from English. Cottage industry is attested from 1921. Cottage cheese is attested from 1831, Amer.Eng., earliest in reference to Philadelphia:  There was a plate of rye-bread, and a plate of wheat, and a basket of crackers; another plate with half a dozen paltry cakes that looked as if they had been bought under the old Court House; some morsels of dried beef on two little tea-cup plates: and a small glass dish of that preparation of curds, which in vulgar language is called smear-case, but whose nomde guerre is cottage-cheese, at least that was the appellation given it by our hostess.

Among the Indians, more than half of every sentence is expressed by signs. And miners illustrate their conversation by the various terms used in mining. I have always noticed how clearly these terms conveyed the idea sought. Awkwardness in comprehending this dialect easily reveals that the hearer bears the disgrace of being a "pilgrim," or a "tender-foot," as they style the new emigrant.

thigh	θai	O.E. þeoh, þeh, from P.Gmc. *theukhom (cf. O.Fris. thiach, O.Du. thio, Du. dij, O.N. þjo, O.H.G. dioh), from PIE *teuk- from root *teu- "to swell" (cf. Lith. taukas, O.C.S. tuku, Rus. tuku "fat of animals;" Lith. tukti "to become fat;" Gk. tylos "callus, lump," tymbos "burial mound, grave, tomb;" O.Ir. ton "rump;" L. tumere "to swell," tumulus "raised heap of earth," tumor "a swelling;" M.Ir. tomm "a small hill," Welsh tom "mound").

Also an Anglo-Saxon and Icelandic runic letter (þ), named for the word of which it was the initial.

thoroughgoing	ˈθʌrəɡəuin	late 14c., variant of errant (q.v.); at first merely derogatory, "wandering, vagrant;" then (1540s) acquiring a meaning "thoroughgoing, downright, notorious."
thoughtful	ˈθɔ:tful	c.1200, "contemplative," from thought + -ful. Also in M.E., "prudent; moody, anxious." Meaning "showing consideration for others" is from 1851 (cf. thoughtless.) Related: Thoughtfully; thoughtfulness.
thrall	θrɔ:l	O.E. þræl "bondman, serf, slave," from O.N. þræll "slave, servant," probably from P.Gmc. *thrakhilaz, lit. "runner," from root *threh- "to run" (cf. O.H.G. dregil "servant," prop. "runner;" O.E. þrægan, Goth. þragjan "to run").
thrash	θræʃ	1580s, "to separate grains from wheat, etc., by beating," dialectal variant of threshen (see thresh). Sense of "beat (someone) with (or as if with) a flail" is first recorded c.1600. Meaning "to make wild movements like those of a flail or whip" is attested from 1846. Related: Thrashed; thrashing. Type of fast heavy metal music first called by this name 1982.
thread	θred	O.E. þræd "fine cord, especially when twisted" (related to þrawan "to twist"), from P.Gmc. *thrædus (cf. M.Du. draet, Du. draad, O.H.G. drat, Ger. Draht, O.N. þraðr), from suffixed form of root *thræ- "twist" (see throw). Meaning "spiral ridge of a screw" is from 1670s. The verb meaning "to put thread through a needle" is recorded from mid-14c.; in reference to film cameras from 1913. The dancing move called thread the needle is attested from 1844. Threads, slang for "clothes" is 1926, Amer.Eng.
threadbare	ˈθredˌbeə	mid-14c., from thread + bare. The notion is of "having the nap worn off," leaving bare the threads.
threat	θret	O.E. þreatnian (see threat). Related: Threatened. Threatening in the sense of "portending no good" is recorded from 1520s.
threnody	ˈθrenədi:	"song of lamentation," 1630s, from Gk. threnodia, from threnos "dirge, lament," + oide "ode." Gk. threnos probably is from a PIE imitative root meaning "to murmur, hum;" cf. O.E. dran "drone," Goth. drunjus "sound," Gk. tenthrene "a kind of wasp."
thresh	θreʃ	O.E. þrescan, þerscan "to beat, sift grain by trampling or beating," from P.Gmc. *threskanan "to thresh," originally "to tread, to stamp noisily" (cf. M.Du. derschen, Du. dorschen, O.H.G. dreskan, Ger. dreschen, O.N. þreskja, Goth. þriskan), from PIE root *tere- "to rub, turn" (see throw). The basic notion is of treading out wheat under foot of men or oxen, later, with the advent of the flail, the word acquired its modern extended sense of "to knock, beat, strike." The original Germanic sense is suggested by the use of the word in Romanic languages that borrowed it, e.g. It. trescare "to prance," O.Fr. treschier "to dance," Sp. triscar "to stamp the feet."
threshold	ˈθreʃhəuld	O.E. þrescold, þærscwold, þerxold "doorsill, point of entering," first element related to O.E. þrescan (see thresh), with its original sense of "tread, trample." Second element of unknown origin and much transformed in all the Germanic languages; in English it probably has been altered to conform to hold, but the oft-repeated story that the threshold was a barrier placed at the doorway to hold the chaff flooring in the room is mere folk etymology. Cognates include O.N. þreskjoldr, Swed. tröskel, O.H.G. driscufli, Ger. dial. drischaufel.
thrift	θrift	c.1300, "fact or condition of thriving," also "prosperity, savings," from M.E. thriven "to thrive" (see thrive), possibly influenced by O.N. þrift, variant of þrif "prosperity," from þrifask "to thrive." Sense of "habit of saving, economy" first recorded 1550s (thrifty in this sense is recorded from 1520s; also see spendthrift). Thrift shop attested by 1919.

throat	θrəut	O.E. þrote (implied in þrotbolla "the Adam's apple, larynx," lit. "throat boll"), related to þrutian "to swell," from P.Gmc. *thrut- (cf. O.H.G. drozza, Ger. Drossel, O.S. strota, M.Du. strote, Du. strot "throat"), perhaps from PIE *trud- (cf. O.E. þrutian "to swell," O.N. þrutna "to swell"). The notion is of "the swollen part" of the neck. It. strozza "throat," strozzare "to strangle" are Gmc. loan-words. College slang for "competitive student" is 1970s, from cutthroat.
throaty	ˈθrəʊti:	 
throb	θrɔb	mid-14c., of uncertain origin, perhaps meant to represent in sound the pulsation of arteries and veins or the heart. The noun is first attested 1570s.
throbbing	ˈθrɔbɪŋ	 
throes	θrəuz	 
throne	θrəun	mid-13c., from O.Fr. trone (12c.), from L. thronus, from Gk. thronos "elevated seat, chair, throne," from PIE root *dher- (2) "to hold firmly, support" (cf. L. firmus "firm, steadfast, strong, stable," Skt. dharma "statute, law;" see firm (adj.)). Colloquial meaning "toilet" is recorded from 1922.
throng	θrɔŋ	c.1300, probably shortened from O.E. geþrang "crowd, tumult" (related to verb þringan "to push, crowd, press"), from P.Gmc. *thrangan (cf. O.N. þröng, Du. drang, Ger. Drang "crowd, throng"). The verb, in the sense of "go in a crowd," is first recorded 1530s. Related: Thronged; thronging.
throttle	ˈθrɔtl	"strangle to death," c.1400, probably from M.E. throte "throat" (see throat). The noun, in the mechanical sense, is first recorded 1870s, from throttle-valve (1824), but was used earlier as a synonym for "throat" (1540s); it appears to be an independent formation, not derived from the verb.
throughout	 θru:ˈaʊt	late O.E. þurhut; see through + out (cf. Ger. durchaus, 16c.).
throwback	ˈθrəubæk	"reversion to an ancestral type or character," 1888, from throw (v.) + back (adv.); earlier it meant "a reverse in a course or progress, a relapse" (1856).
thrust	θrʌst	late 12c., from O.N. þrysta "to thrust, force," from P.Gmc. *thrustijanan, perhaps from PIE *trud- "push, press" (see threat), but OED finds this derivation doubtful. The noun is recorded from 1510s; figurative sense of "principal theme, aim, point, purpose" is recorded from 1968.
thumb	θʌm	O.E. þuma, from W.Gmc. *thumon- (cf. O.Fris. thuma, O.S., O.H.G. thumo, Ger. Daumen, Du. duim "thumb," O.N. þumall "thumb of a glove"), lit. "the stout or thick (finger)," from PIE *tum- "swell" (cf. L. tumere "to swell," tumidus "swollen;" Avestan tuma "fat;" see thigh). For spelling with -b (attested from late 13c.), see limb. The verb meaning "to go through" (especially of printed material) is first found 1930, though the related sense of "soil or wear by handling" dates from 1640s. Verb meaning "to hitchhike" is 1939, originally the thumb pointed in the direction one wished to travel. To be under (someone's) thumb "be totally controlled by that person" is recorded from 1580s. Thumbs up (1887) and thumbs down (1906) were said to be from expressions of approval or the opposite in ancient amphitheaters, especially gladiator shows, where the gesture decided whether a defeated combatant was spared or slain. But the Roman gesture was merely one of hiding the thumb in the hand or extending it. Perhaps the modern gesture is from the usual coachmen's way of greeting while the hands are occupied with the reins.
thump	θʌmp	1530s, "to strike hard," probably imitative of the sound made by hitting with a heavy object (cf. E.Fris. dump "a knock," Swed. dial. dumpa "to make a noise"). The noun is first recorded 1550s. Thumping (adj.) "exceptionally large" is colloquial from 1570s.

Skt. tanayitnuh "thundering," Pers. tundar "thunder," L. tonare "to thunder"). Swed. tordön is lit. "Thor's din." The intrusive -d- is also found in Dutch and Icelandic versions of the word. The verb is O.E. þunrian; figurative sense of "to speak loudly, threateningly, bombastically" is recorded from mid-14c. Related: Thundered; thundering.
thwart	θwɔ:t	c.1200, from O.N. þvert "across," originally neut. of thverr (adj.) "transverse, across," cognate with O.E. þweorh "transverse, perverse, angry, cross," from P.Gmc. *thwerkhaz (cf. M.Du. dwers, Du. dwars "cross-grained, contrary," O.H.G. twerh, Ger. quer, Goth. þwairhs "angry"), altered (by influence of *thwer- "to turn") from *therkh-, from PIE *twork-/*twerk- "twist" (cf. L. torquere "to twist," Skt. tarkuh "spindle," O.C.S. traku "band, girdle," O.H.G. drahsil "turner," Ger. drechseln "to turn on a lathe"). The verb meaning "oppose, hinder" is mid-13c., from the adv. and prep.
thyroid	ˈθaɪˌrɔɪd	1690s (in ref. to both the cartilage and the gland), from Gk. thyreoiedes "shield-shaped" (in khondros thyreoiedes "shield-shaped cartilage," used by Galen to describe the "Adam's apple" in the throat), from thyreos "oblong, door-shaped shield" (from thyra "door") + -eides "form, shape." The noun, short for thyroid gland, is recorded from 1849.
tibia	ˈtɪbi:ə	lower leg bone, 1726, from L. tibia "shinbone," also "pipe, flute," in which sense it originally came into English (1540s). Of unknown origin. The Latin plural is tibiæ.
tick	tik	mid-15c., "light touch or tap," probably from tick (v.) and cognate with Du. tik, M.H.G. zic, and perhaps echoic. Meaning "sound made by a clock" is probably first recorded 1540s; tick-tock is recorded from 1848.
tickle	ˈtikl	early 14c. (intrans.) "to be thrilled or tingling," of uncertain origin, possibly a frequentative form of tick (2) in its older sense of "to touch." The O.E. form was tinclian. Some suggest a metathesis of kittle (M.E. kytyllen), from Du. kietelen, from a common North Sea Germanic word for "to tickle" (cf. O.N. kitla, O.H.G. kizzilon, Ger. kitzeln). Meaning "to excite agreeably" (late 14c.) is a translation of L. titillare. Meaning "to touch lightly so as to cause a peculiar and uneasy sensation" is recorded from late 14c.; that of "to poke or touch so as to excite laughter" is from early 15c.; figurative sense of "to excite, amuse" is attested from 1680s. Related: Tickled; tickling. The noun is recorded from 1801. Tickled "pleased, happy" is from 1580s.
tickler	ˈtɪklə	1610s, coined in Modern Latin, from Late Gk. kleitoris, a diminutive, but the exact sense is uncertain. Perhaps from Gk. kleiein "to sheathe," also "to shut," in reference to its being covered by the labia minora. The related Greek noun form kleis has a second meaning of "a key, a latch or hook (to close a door);" see close (v.), and cf. slot (2). Some ancient medical sources give a supposed Greek verb kleitoriazein "to touch or titillate lasciviously, to tickle" (cf. Ger. slang der Kitzler "clitoris," lit. "the tickler"), but the verb is likely from the anatomy in this case. Perhaps related to Gk. kleitys, a variant of klitys "side of a hill," itself related to klinein "to slope," from the same root as climax (see lean (v.)), and with a sense of "little hill." The anatomist Mateo Renaldo Colombo (1516-1559), professor at Padua, claimed to have discovered it ("De re anatomica," 1559, p. 243). He called it amor Veneris, vel dulcedo "the love or sweetness of Venus." It had been known earlier to women.
ticklish	ˈtɪklɪʃ	"easily tickled," 1590s, from tickle + -ish. Literal sense is later than the fig. sense (1580s); an earlier word for this was tickly (1520s). Related: Ticklishly; ticklishness.
tiddler	ˈtɪdlə	 
tide	taid	O.E. tid "point or portion of time, due time," from P.Gmc. *tidiz "division of time" (cf. O.S. tid, Du. tijd, O.H.G. zit, Ger. Zeit "time"), from PIE *di-ti- "division, division of time," suffixed form of root *da- "to divide, cut up" (cf. Skt. dati "cuts, divides;" Gk. demos "people, land," perhaps lit. "division of society;" daiesthai "to divide;" O.Ir. dam "troop, company"). Meaning "rise and fall of the sea" (mid-14c.) is probably via notion of "fixed time," specifically "time of high water;" either a native evolution or from M.L.G. getide (cf. also Du. tij, Ger. Gezeiten "flood tide"). O.E. had no specific word for this, using flod and ebba to refer to the rise and fall. O.E. heahtid "high tide" meant âfestival, high day.â The verb meaning "to carry (as the tide does)" is recorded from 1620s, usually with over. Related: Tided; tiding.
tidings	ˈtaɪdɪŋz	"announcement of an event," 1069, from O.E. tidung "event, occurrence, piece of news," perhaps in part a verbal noun from O.E. tidan "to happen," in part from O.N. tiðendi (pl.) "events, news," from tiðr (adj.) "occurring," from PIE *di-ti- (see tide). Cf. Norw. tidende "tidings, news," Du. tijding, Ger. Zeitung "newspaper").
tidy	ˈtaidi	mid-13c., probably originally "in season, timely, opportune, excellent," from tide in the sense of "season, time" (see tide). Cf. O.H.G. zitig, Ger. zeitig, Du. tijdig, Dan. tidig "timely." Meaning "neat and in order" first recorded 1706. The verb in this sense is from 1821.
tier	tɪə	"row, rank, range," 1560s, from M.Fr. tire, from O.Fr. tire "rank, sequence, order" (early 13c.), probably from tirer "to draw, draw out" (see tirade). Some suggests the O.Fr. noun is from a Germanic source akin to O.H.G. ziari, Ger. Zier "adornment," O.E. tir "glory, honor."
tiff	tɪf	1727, "outburst of temper," later "small quarrel" (1754), of uncertain origin; OED suggests onomatopoeic, "from the sound of a slight puff of air or gas."

tighten	ˈtaɪtn	"to make tight," 1727; the earlier verb was simply tight, from O.E. tyhtan, from the root of tight.
tightfisted	ˈtaɪtˈfɪstɪd	 
tightwad	ˈtaitwɔd	"parsimonious person," 1900, from tight in the sense of "close-fisted" (1805) + wad. The notions of stringency and avarice also combine in Mod.Gk. sphiktos "greedy," lit. "tight."
tile	tail	O.E. tigele "roofing shingle," from W.Gmc. *tegala (cf. O.H.G. ziagal, Ger. ziegel, Du. tegel, O.N. tigl), a borrowing from L. tegula "tile" (cf. It. tegola, Fr. tuile), from tegere "roof, to cover" (see stegosaurus). Also used in O.E. and early M.E. for "brick," before that word came into use. The verb meaning "to cover with tiles" is recorded from late 14c.

tilt	tilt	"a joust, a combat," 1510s, perhaps from tilt (v.) on the notion of "to lean" into an attack, but the word originally seems to have been the name of the barrier which separated the combatants, which suggests connection with tilt in an earlier meaning "covering of coarse cloth, an awning" (mid-15c.), which is probably from tilt (v.), but perhaps related to or influenced by tent, or it may be from a Germanic source akin to O.E. beteldan "to cover." The verb is recorded from 1590s. Hence, also full tilt (c.1600).
tilted	 	O.E. *tyltan "to be unsteady," from tealt "unsteady," from P.Gmc. *taltaz (cf. O.N. tyllast "to trip," Swed. tulta "to waddle," Norw. tylta "to walk on tip-toe," M.Du. touteren "to swing"). Meaning "to cause to lean, tip, slope" (1590s) is from sense of "push or fall over." Intrans. sense first recorded 1620s. Meaning "condition of being tilted" is recorded from 1837.
timber	ˈtimbə	O.E. timber "building, structure," later "building material, trees suitable for building," and "wood in general," from P.Gmc. *temran (cf. O.Fris. timber "wood, building," O.H.G. zimbar "timber, wooden dwelling, room," O.N. timbr "timber," Ger. Zimmer "room"), from PIE *demrom-, from root *dem-/*dom- "build" (source of Gk. domos, L. domus; see domestic). The related Old English verb timbran, timbrian was the chief word for "to build" (cf. Du. timmeren, Ger. zimmern). As a call of warning when a cut tree is about to fall, it is attested from 1912 in Canadian English. Timbers in the nautical slang sense (see shiver (n.)) is from the specialized meaning "pieces of wood composing the frames of a ship's hull" (1748).
timbre	ˈtæmbə	"characteristic quality of a musical sound," 1849, from Fr. timbre "quality of a sound," earlier "sound of a bell," from O.Fr., "bell without a clapper," originally "drum," probably via Medieval Gk. *timbanon, from Gk. tympanon "kettledrum" (see tympanum). Timbre was used in O.Fr. (13c.) and M.E. (14c.) to render L. tympanum in Ps. 150.
time	taim	O.E. getimian "to happen, befall," from time (n.). Meaning "to appoint a time" (of an action, etc.) is attested from c.1300; sense of "to record the time of" (a race, event, etc.) is first attested 1660s. 
timely	ˈtaimli	late O.E. (adv.), from time (n.). As an adj. meaning "occurring at a suitable time" it is attested from c.1200.
times	taɪmz	late 14c., "olden times," from O.Fr. antiquitet (11c.; Mod.Fr. antiquité) "olden times; great age; old age," from L. antiquitatem (nom. antiquitas) "ancient times, antiquity, venerableness," noun of quality from antiquus (see antique (adj.)). Specific reference to ancient Greece and Rome is from mid-15c.; meaning "quality of being old" is from about the same time. Antiquities "relics of ancient days" is from 1510s.

Not found in Scandinavian or Gothic, and with no known cognates outside Germanic. The more usual I.E. word for the animal is represented by ewe. As a type of timidity, from O.E.; the meaning "stupid, timid person" is attested from 1540s. The image of the wolf in sheep's clothing was in O.E. (from Matt. vii:15); that of separating the sheep from the goats is from Matt. xxv:33. To count sheep in a bid to induce sleep is recorded from 1854. Sheep's eyes "loving looks" is attested from 1520s (cf. W.Fris. skiepseach, Du. schaapsoog, Ger. Schafsauge).
timorous	ˈtɪmərəs	mid-15c., from O.Fr. temeros (14c.), from M.L. timorosus "fearful," from L. timor "fear," from timere "to fear." Some early sense confused by mistaken identification with M.E. temerous "rash" (see temerity).
tin	tin	O.E. tin, from P.Gmc. *tinom (cf. M.Du., Du. tin, O.H.G. zin, Ger. Zinn, O.N. tin), of unknown origin, not found outside Germanic. Other Indo-European languages often have separate words for âtinâ as a raw metal and âtin plate;â e.g. Fr. étain, fer-blanc. Pliny refers to tin as plumbum album "white lead," and for centuries it was regarded as a form of silver debased by lead. The chemical symbol Sn is from L.L. stannum (see stannic). Tin-type in photography is from 1864. Tin ear "lack of musical discernment" is from 1909. Tin Lizzie "early Ford, especially a Model T," first recorded 1915.

tinker	ˈtɪŋkə	"mender of kettles, pots, pans, etc.," mid-13c. (as a surname), of uncertain origin. Some connect the word with the sound made by light hammering on metal. The verb meaning "to keep busy in a useless way" is first found 1650s. Tinker's damn "something slight and worthless" is from 1824, probably simply preserving tinkers' reputation for free and casual use of profanity; more elaborate derivations exist, but seem to be just-so stories without evidence.
tint	tɪnt	"color," 1717, alteration of tinct (c.1600), from L. tinctus "a dyeing," from tingere "to dye" (see tincture); influenced by It. tinta "tint, hue," from L. tinctus. The verb is attested from 1756 (implied in tinted).
tiny	ˈtaini	c.1400, tyne "very small," perhaps from tine.
tip	tip	"to slope, overturn," c.1300, possibly from Scandinavian, or a special use of tip (n.). Intransitive sense of "fall over" is recorded from 1520s. Related: Tipped; tipping. Tipping point attested by 1972.

tirade	ˈtaɪˌreɪd	1801, "a 'volley of words,' " from Fr. tirade "speech, volley, shot, continuation, drawing out" (16c.), from tirer "draw out, endure, suffer," or the Fr. word is perhaps from cognate It. tirata "a volley," from pp. of tirare "to draw." The whole Romanic word group is of uncertain origin; some think it is a shortening of the source of O.Fr. martirer "endure martyrdom" (see martyr).
tire	ˈtaiə	late 15c., "iron rim of a carriage wheel," probably from tire "equipment, dress, covering" (c.1300), an aphetic form of attire. The notion is of the tire as the dressing of the wheel. The original spelling was tyre, which had shifted to tire in 17c.-18c., but since early 19c. tyre has been revived in Great Britain and become standard there. Rubber ones, for bicycles (later automobiles) are from 1870s.
tissue	ˈtisju:	mid-14c., "band or belt of rich material," from O.Fr. tissu "a ribbon, headband, belt of woven material" (c.1200), noun use of tissu "woven, interlaced," pp. of tistre "to weave," from L. texere "weave" (see texture). The biological sense is first recorded 1831, from Fr., introduced c.1800 by Fr. anatomist Marie-François-Xavier Bichal (1771-1802).

Some speculate that it originally meant "creature that walks clumsily," and derives from P.Gmc. *truzlan, from *truzlanan (see troll (v.)). But it seems to have been a general supernatural word, cf. Swed. trolla "to charm, bewitch;" O.N. trolldomr "witchcraft." The old sagas tell of the troll-bull, a supernatural being in the form of a bull, as well as boar-trolls.

The word was popularized in English by 19c. antiquarians, but it has been current in the Shetlands and Orkneys since Viking times. The first record of it is from a court document from the Shetlands, regarding a certain Catherine, who, among other things, was accused of "airt and pairt of witchcraft and sorcerie, in hanting and seeing the Trollis ryse out of the kyrk yeard of Hildiswick."

tuxedo	tʌkˈsi:dəʊ	man's evening dress for semiformal occasions, 1889, named for Tuxedo Park, N.Y., site of a country club where it first was worn in 1886. The name is an attractive subject for elaborate speculation, e.g.:  The Wolf tribe in New York was called in scorn by other Algonquians tuksit: round foot, implying that they easily fell down in surrender. In their region thus came the names Tuxedo and Tuxedo Lake, which were acquired by the Griswold family in payment of a debt. There the family established the exclusive Tuxedo Club, and there in the late 1880s Griswold Lorillard first appeared in a dinner jacket without tails, a tuxedo. By a twist of slang, one may now refer to a man in a tuxedo as a 'wolf. [Joseph T. Shipley, "The Origins of English Words," 1984]  But in another version of the story, p'tuksit was the Algonquian word for "wolf," the animal, perhaps from the shape of its paws. The authoritative Bright, however, says the tribe's name probably is originally a place name, perhaps Munsee Delaware (Algonquian) p'tuck-sepo "crooked river." Short form tux is attested from 1922. 
twaddle	ˈtwɔdl	"silly talk," 1782, probably from twattle (1550s), of obscure origin.
tweak	twi:k	"pinch, pluck, twist," usually to the nose, probably from O.E. twiccian "to pluck," of obscure origin; perhaps related to twitch. Meaning "to make fine adjustments" is attested from 1966. Related: Tweaked; tweaking. The noun in this sense is recorded by 1989.
twee	twi:	"tiny, dainty, miniature," 1905, from childish pronunciation of sweet.
tweezers	ˈtwi:zəz	1650s, extended from tweezes, plural of tweeze "case for tweezers" (1620s), aphetic of etweese, considered as plural of etwee (1610s) "a small case," from Fr. étui "small case" (see etui). Sense transferred from the case to the implement inside it.
twiddle	ˈtwɪdl	1540s, "to trifle," of unknown origin; of the fingers, first recorded 1670s. Figurative phrase twiddle one's thumbs "have nothing to do" is recorded from 1846; to twirl one's thumbs in the same sense is recorded from 1816. Related: Twiddled; twiddling.
twig	twiɡ	O.E. twigge, from P.Gmc. *twigan (cf. M.Du. twijch, Du. twijg, O.H.G. zwig, Ger. Zweig "branch, twig"), from the root of twi- (see twin), here meaning "forked" (as in O.E. twisel "fork, point of division").
twilight	ˈtwailait	late 14c. (twilighting), a compound of twi- + light (n.) Cognate with Du. tweelicht (16c.), Ger. zwielicht. Exact connotation of twi- in this word is unclear, but it appears to refer to "half" light, rather than the fact that twilight occurs twice a day. Cf. also Skt. samdhya "twilight," lit. "a holding together, junction," M.H.G. zwischerliecht, lit. "tweenlight." Originally and most commonly in English with reference to evening twilight but occasionally used of morning twilight (a sense first attested mid-15c.). Figurative extension is first recorded c.1600.
twinge	twɪndʒ	1540s, "a pinch," from obsolete verb twinge "to pinch, tweak," from O.E. twengan "to pinch," of uncertain origin. Meaning "sharp, sudden pain" is recorded from c.1600. Figurative sense (with reference to shame, remorse, etc.) is recorded from 1620s.
twinkle	ˈtwɪŋkəl	O.E. twinclian, frequentative of twincan "to wink, blink;" related to M.H.G. zwinken, Ger. zwinkern, and probably somehow imitative. The noun is recorded from 1540s. Related: Twinkled; twinkling. Phrase in the twinkling of an eye is attested from c.1300.
twirl	twɜ:l	1590s (n. and v.), of uncertain origin, possibly connected with O.E. þwirl "a stirrer." Or else a blend of twist and whirl. Related: Twirled; twirling.
twist	twist	early 14c. (implied in p.t. twaste), "to wring," from the source of twist (n.). Sense of "to spin two or more strands of yarn into thread" is attested from late 15c. Meaning "to move in a winding fashion" is recorded from 1630s. To twist the lion's tail was U.S. slang (1895) for "to provoke British feeling." Related: Twisted; twisting.
twit	twɪt	1520s, aphetic form of atwite, from O.E. ætwitan "to blame, reproach," from æt "at" + witan "to blame," from P.Gmc. *witanan (cf. O.E. wite, O.S. witi, O.N. viti "punishment, torture;" O.H.G. wizzi "punishment," wizan "to punish;" Du. verwijten, O.H.G. firwizan, Ger. verweisen "to reproach, reprove," Goth. fraweitan "to avenge"), from PIE root *weid- "to see." For sense evolution, cf. L. animadvertere, lit. "to give heed to, observe," later "to chastise, censure, punish." The noun meaning "foolish, stupid and ineffectual person" is first attested 1934 in British slang, popular 1950s-60s, crossed over to U.S. with British sitcoms. It probably developed from the verb sense of "reproach" but may be influenced by nitwit.
twitch	twitʃ	late 12c., to-twic-chen "pull apart with a quick jerk," related to O.E. twiccian "to pluck," from P.Gmc. *twikjonan (cf. Low Ger. twicken, Du. twikken, O.H.G. gizwickan, Ger. zwicken "to pinch, tweak"). Related: Twitched; twitching. The noun is attested from 1520s.
tycoon	taɪˈku:n	1857, title given by foreigners to the shogun of Japan (said to have been used by his supporters when addressing foreigners, as an attempt to convey that the shogun was more important than the emperor), from Japanese taikun "great lord or prince," from Chinese tai "great" + kiun "lord." Transf. meaning "important person" is attested from 1861, in reference to U.S. president Abraham Lincoln (in Hay's diary); specific application to "businessman" is post-World War I. 
typhoid	ˈtaɪˌfɔɪd	1800, lit. "resembling typhus," from typhus + suffix from Gk. -oeides "like," from eidos "form, shape" (see -oid). The noun is from 1861, a shortened form of typhoid fever (1845), so called because it was originally thought to be a variety of typhus. Typhoid Mary (1909) was Mary Mallon (d.1938), a typhoid carrier who worked as a cook and became notorious after it was learned she had unwittingly infected hundreds in U.S.
typhoon	taiˈfu:n	Tiphon "violent storm, whirlwind, tornado," 1550s, from Gk. typhon "whirlwind," personified as a giant, father of the winds, perhaps from typhein "to smoke" (cf. typhus). The meaning "cyclone, violent hurricane of India or the China Seas" (1580s) is first recorded in T. Hickock's translation of an account in Italian of a voyage to the East Indies by Caesar Frederick, a merchant of Venice:  concerning which Touffon ye are to vnderstand, that in the East Indies often times, there are not stormes as in other countreys; but euery 10. or 12. yeeres there are such tempests and stormes, that it is a thing incredible, but to those that haue seene it, neither do they know certainly what yeere they wil come. ["The voyage and trauell of M. Caesar Fredericke, Marchant of Venice, into the East India, and beyond the Indies"]  This sense of the word, in reference to titanic storms in the East Indies, first appears in Europe in Portuguese in the mid-16th century. It aparently is from tufan, a word in Arabic, Persian, and Hindi meaning "big cyclonic storm." Yule ["Hobson-Jobson," London, 1903] writes that "the probability is that Vasco [da Gama] and his followers got the tufao ... direct from the Arab pilots." The Arabic word sometimes is said to be from Gk. typhon, but other sources consider it purely Semitic, though the Greek word might have influenced the form of the word in English.  Al-tufan occurs several times in the Koran for "a flood or storm" and also for Noah's Flood. Chinese (Cantonese) tai fung "a great wind" also might have influenced the form or sense of the word in English, and that term and the Indian one may have had some mutual influence; toofan still means "big storm" in India.
typical	ˈtipikəl	c.1600, "symbolic, emblematic," from M.L. typicalis "symbolic," from L.L. typicus "of or pertaining to a type," from Gk. typikos, from typos "impression" (see type). Sense of "characteristic" is first recorded 1850. Related: Typically.
typo	ˈtaipəu	1816, short for typographer; 1892 as short for typographical error (see typography).
typographical	ˌtaipəˈɡræfikəl	"pertaining to typography," 1590s; see typography + -ical.
typology	taɪˈpɔlədʒi:	1845, from Gk. typos (see type) + -ology.
tyrannical	tɪˈrænɪkəl	1530s; see tyranny + -ical. Tyrannic was used in this sense from late 15c.
tyranny	ˈtirəni	late 14c., "cruel or unjust use of power," from O.Fr. tyrannie (13c.), from L.L. tyrannia "tyranny," from Gk. tyrannia "rule of a tyrant," from tyrannos "master" (see tyrant).
tyrant	ˈtaɪərənt	c.1300, "absolute ruler," from O.Fr. tyrant (12c.), from L. tyrannus "lord, master, tyrant" (cf. Sp. tirano, It. tiranno), from Gk. tyrannos "lord, master, sovereign, absolute ruler," a loan-word from a language of Asia Minor (probably Lydian); cf. Etruscan Turan "mistress, lady" (surname of Venus). In the exact sense, a tyrant is an individual who arrogates to himself the royal authority without having a right to it. This is how the Greeks understood the word 'tyrant': they applied it indifferently to good and bad princes whose authority was not legitimate. [Rousseau, "The Social Contract"]  The spelling with -t arose in O.Fr. by analogy with prp. endings in -ant. Fem. form tyranness is recorded from 1590 (Spenser); cf. M.L. tyrannissa (late 14c.).
tyre	ˈtaiə	variant spelling of tire (n.).
tyro	ˈtaɪərəʊ	1610s, from M.L. tyro, variant of L. tiro (pl. tirones) "young soldier, recruit, beginner," of unknown origin.
tyrosine	ˈtaɪərəˌsi:n	amino acid, 1857, coined 1846 by German chemist Baron von Justus Liebig (1802-1873), who had first obtained it a year before, from Gk. tyros "cheese" + chemical suffix -ine (2). So called because it was easily obtained from old cheese.
ubiquitous	ju:ˈbɪkwɪtəs	"turning up everywhere," 1837, from ubiquity + -ous. The earlier word was ubiquitary (1580s), from Mod.L. ubiquitarius, from ubique. Related: Ubiquitously; ubiquitousness.
ugly	ˈʌɡli	mid-13c., uglike "frightful or horrible in appearance," from O.N. uggligr "dreadful, fearful," from uggr "fear, apprehension, dread" (perhaps related to agg "strife, hate") + -ligr "-like." Meaning softened to "very unpleasant to look at" late 14c. Extended sense of "morally offensive" is attested from c.1300; that of "ill-tempered" is from 1680s.  Among words for this concept, ugly is unusual in being formed from a root for "fear, dread." More common is a compound meaning "ill-shaped" (e.g. Gk. dyseides, L. deformis, Ir. dochrud, Skt. ku-rupa). Another Germanic group has a root sense of "hate, sorrow" (see loath). Ugly duckling (1877) is from the story by Hans Christian Andersen, first translated from Danish to English 1846. Ugly American "U.S. citizen who behaves offensively abroad" is first recorded 1958 as a book title.

Or perhaps from O.Fr. embroue "soiled," ultimately from boue "mud, dirt."
ultimatum	ˌʌltiˈmeitəm	1731, from Modern Latin, from Medieval Latin adjective ultimatum "last possible, final," from L. ultimatum, neuter of ultimatus (see ultimate). Hamilton and others use the Latin plural ultimata. In slang c.1820s, ultimatum was used for "the buttocks."
ultramundane	ˌʌltrəˈmʌnˌdeɪn	 
ultrasonic	ˌʌltrəˈsɔnɪk	1923, "having frequency beyond the audible range," from ultra- + sonic. For sense, see supersonic.
ultrasonics	ˌʌltrəˈsɔnɪks	 
ultraviolet	ˌʌltrəˈvaiəlit	"beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum," 1840, from ultra- + violet. Ultra-red (1870) was a former name for what now is called infra-red.
umbrage	ˈʌmbrɪdʒ	early 15c., "shadow, shade," from M.Fr. ombrage "shade, shadow," from L. umbraticum, neut. of umbraticus "of or pertaining to shade," from umbra "shade, shadow," from PIE root *andho- "blind, dark" (cf. Skt. andha-, Avestan anda- "blind, dark").

unbend	ʌnˈbend	"to relax a bow by unstringing it," mid-13c., from un- (2) + bend (v.). Figurative meaning "to become genial, relax" (1748) has a sense opposite to that of unbending "inflexible, obstinate" (1680s), which does not derive from the bowstringing image.
unbiased	ʌnˈbaɪəst	c.1600, literal, in reference to throws at bowls, from un- (1) "not" + biased. Figurative sense of "impartial, unprejudiced" is recorded from 1640s.

uncalled-for	ʌnˈkɔ:ldˌfɔ:	prefix of negation, O.E. un-, from P.Gmc. *un- (cf. O.Fris., O.H.G., Ger. un-, Goth. un-, Du. on-), from PIE *n- (cf. Skt. a-, an- "not," Gk. a-, an-, O.Ir. an-, L. in-), a variant of PIE root *ne- "not" (cf. Avestan na, O.C.S., Lith. ne "not," L. ne "that not," Gk. ne- "not," O.Ir. ni, Corn. ny "not").  Freely and widely used since Old English in compounds with native and imported words, it disputes with Latin-derived cognate in- the right to form the negation of certain words (indigestable/undigestable, etc.). Often euphemistic (e.g. untruth for "lie"). The most prolific of English prefixes, it even is used to make words from phrases (e.g. uncalled-for, c.1600; undreamed-of, 1630s; uncome-at-able, 1690s; unputdownable, 1947, of a book; un-in-one-breath-utterable, Ben Jonson; etc.).

Figurative sense of "blandly ingratiating" is first recorded 1742, perhaps in part with a literal sense, but in part a sarcastic usage from unction in the meaning "deep spiritual feeling" (1690s), such as comes from having been anointed in the rite of unction.

"heaven," in Greek cosmology, the god who personifies the heavens, father of the titans. Cf. Urania, name of the Muse of astronomy, from Gk. Ourania, fem. of ouranios, lit. "heavenly."  The planet was discovered and identified as such in 1781 by Sir William Herschel (it had been observed before, but mistaken for a star, e.g. in 1690 when John Flamsteed cataloged it as 34 Tauri); Herschel proposed calling it Georgium Sidus, lit. "George's Star," in honour of his patron, King George III of England. I cannot but wish to take this opportunity of expressing my sense of gratitude, by giving the name of Georgium Sidus ... to a star which (with respect to us) first began to shine under His auspicious reign. [Sir William Herschel, 1783] The planet was known in English in 1780s as the Georgian Planet; French astronomers began calling Herschel, and ultimately German astronomer Johann Bode proposed Uranus as in conformity with other planet names. However, the name didn't come into common usage until c.1850.

O.N. vaða, Dan. vade, O.Fris. wada, Du. waden, O.H.G. watan, Ger. waten "to wade"), from PIE root *wadh- "to go," found only in Germanic and Latin (cf. L. vadere "to go," vadum "shoal, ford," vadare "to wade"). Italian guado, Fr. gué "ford" are Germanic loan-words.  Specifically of walking into water from c.1200. Originally a strong verb (p.t. wod, pp. wad); weak since 16c. Figurative sense of "to go into" (action, battle, etc.) is recorded from late 14c. Related: Waded; wading.
waffle	ˈwɔfəl	1744, from Du. wafel "waffle," from M.Du. or M.L.G. wafel; cognate with O.H.G. waba "honeycomb" (Ger. Wabe) and related to O.H.G. weban, O.E. wefan "to weave" (see weave). Sense of "honeycomb" is preserved in some combinations referring to a weave of cloth. Waffle iron is from 1794.

The meaning "pass through air or space, float" is first attested 1704, and possibly shows some influence of northern dialect waff "cause to move to and fro" (1510s), a variant of wave. Related: Wafted; wafting.
wag	wæɡ	early 13c., "waver, vacillate, lack steadfastness," probably from a Scandinavian source (cf. O.N. vagga "a cradle," Dan. vugge "rock a cradle," O.Swed. wagga "fluctuate"), and in part from O.E. wagian "move backwards and forwards;" all from P.Gmc. *wagojanan (cf. O.H.G. weggen, Goth. wagjan "to wag"), probably from PIE root *wegh- "to move about" (see weigh). Meaning "to move back and forth or up and down" is from c.1300. Wagtail is attested from c.1500 as a kind of small bird (late 12c. as a surname); 18c. as "a harlot," but seems to be implied much earlier:  If therefore thou make not thy mistress a goldfinch, thou mayst chance to find her a wagtaile. [Lyly, "Midas," 1592]  Wag-at-the-wall (1825) was an old name for a hanging clock with pendulum and weights exposed.
wage	weidʒ	early 14c., "to pledge, deposit as a pledge," from O.N.Fr. wagier (O.Fr. gagier), from wage (see wage (n.)). Meaning "to carry on" (of war, etc.) is attested from mid-15c., probably from earlier sense of "to offer as a gage of battle" (early 15c.).

Wagen), from PIE *woghnos, from *wegh- "to carry, to move" (cf. Skt. vahanam "vessel, ship," Gk. okhos, L. vehiculum, O.C.S. vozu "carriage, chariot," Rus. povozka, Lith. vazis "a small sledge," O.Ir. fen, Welsh gwain "carriage, cart;" see weigh).  In Dutch and German, the general word for "a wheel vehicle;" English use is a result of contact through Flemish immigration, Dutch trade, or the Continental wars. It has largely displaced the native cognate, wain. Spelling preference varied randomly between -g- and -gg- from mid-18c., before American English settled on the etymological wagon, while waggon remained common in Great Britain. Wagon train is attested from 1810. Phrase on the wagon "abstaining from alcohol" is 1904, originally on the water cart.
waif	weɪf	late 14c., "unclaimed property, flotsam, stray animal," from Anglo-Norm. waif, gwaif (early 13c.) "ownerless property," probably from a Scandinavian source akin to O.N. veif "waving thing, flag," from P.Gmc. *waif-, from PIE *weip- "to turn, vacillate, tremble ecstatically" (see vibrate). Cf. M.L. waivium "thing thrown away by a thief in flight." A Scottish/northern English parallel form was wavenger (late 15c.).  Meaning "person (especially a child) without home or friends" first attested 1784, from legal phrase waif and stray (1620s). Neglected children being uncommonly thin, the word tended toward this sense. Connotations of "fashionable, small, slender woman" began 1991 with application to childishly slim supermodels, e.g. Kate Moss.
wail	weil	early 14c., from O.N. væla "to lament," from væ "woe" (see woe). Of jazz musicians, "to play very well," attested from 1955, American English slang (wailing "excellent" is attested from 1954). The noun is recorded from c.1400.
wainscot	ˈweɪnskət	mid-14c., "imported oak of superior quality," probably from M.Du. or M.Flem. waghenscote "superior quality oak wood, board used for paneling" (though neither of these is attested as early as the English word), related to M.L.G. wagenschot (late 14c.), from waghen (see wagon) + scote "partition, crossbar." So called perhaps because the wood originally was used for wagon building and coachwork. Meaning "panels lining the walls of rooms" is recorded from 1540s. Wainscoting is from 1570s.
waive	weɪv	c.1300, from Anglo-Fr. weyver "to abandon, waive," O.Fr. weyver, guever "to abandon, give back," probably from a Scandinavian source akin to O.N. veifa "to swing about," from P.Gmc. *waibijanan (see waif).

The verb meaning "to thrash" (1820) and the noun meaning "heavy blow" (1823) may be separate developments, of imitative origin.
wallow	ˈwɔləʊ	O.E. wealwian "to roll," from W.Gmc. *walwojan, from PIE *wal-, *wel- "to roll" (see vulva). Figurative sense of "to plunge and remain in some state or condition" is attested from early 13c. Related: Wallowed; wallowing. The noun is recorded from 1590s.
walrus	ˈwɔ:lrəs	1650s, from Du. walrus, which was probably a folk-etymology alteration (by influence of Du. walvis "whale" and ros "horse") of a Scandinavian word, such as O.N. rosmhvalr "walrus," hrosshvalr "a kind of whale," or rostungr "walrus." O.E. had horschwæl, and later morse, from Lapp morsa or Finnish mursu, which ultimately might be the source, much garbled, of the first element in O.N. rosmhvalr.
wan	wɔn	O.E. wann "dark, lacking luster," later "leaden, pale, gray," of uncertain origin, and not found in other Germanic languages. The connecting notion is colorlessness. Perhaps related to wane.

O.S. wanon, O.N. vana, O.Fris. wania, M.Du. waenen, O.H.G. wanon "to wane, to grow less"), from *wano- "lacking," from PIE *we-no-, from root *eue- "to leave, abandon, give out" (see vain). Related: Waned; waning; wanes.
wangle	ˈwæŋgəl	"obtain something by trickery," 1888, originally British printer's slang for "fake by manipulation;" perhaps an alteration of waggle, or of wankle (now dial.) "unsteady, fickle," from O.E. wancol (see wench). Brought into wider use by World War I soldiers.

want	wɔnt	c.1200, "to be lacking," from O.N. vanta "to lack, want," earlier *wanaton, from P.Gmc. *wanen, from PIE *we-no-, from root *eue- "to leave, abandon, give out" (see vain). The meaning "desire, wish for" is first recorded 1706. Related: wanted; wanting.

wardrobe	ˈwɔ:drəub	late 14c., "room where wearing apparel is kept," earlier "a private chamber" (c.1300), from O.N.Fr. warderobe, variant of O.Fr. garderobe "place where garments are kept," from warder "to keep, guard" (see ward (v.)) + robe "garment" (see robe).

Sense evolved via notion of "permission from a superior which protects one from blame or responsibility" (c.1300) to "document conveying authority" (1510s). A warrant officer in the military is one who holds office by warrant, rather than by commission.

Or the Old French forms may derive from the prp. of O.Fr. warir "defend, keep," from the Germanic root *war- "to protect, guard" (source of O.E. warian "take care;" see warrant (n.)).

A chance word, upon paper, may destroy the world. Watch carefully and erase, while the power is still yours, I say to myself, for all that is put down, once it escapes, may rot its way into a thousand minds, the corn become a black smut, and all libraries, of necessity, be burned to the ground as a consequence.
