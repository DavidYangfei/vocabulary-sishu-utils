The root meaning in "turning" connects it with axle and axis.

The word also was confused with alley, which gave it the sense of "passage between rows of pews or seats" (1731), which was thence extended to railway cars, theaters, etc.
akin	əˈkɪn	1550s, from phrase of kin; see kin.
alabaster	ˈæləˌbæstə	translucent whitish kind of gypsum used for vases, ornaments, and busts, late 14c., from O.Fr. alabastre (12c., Mod.Fr. albâtre), from L. alabaster "colored rock used to make boxes and vessels for unguents," from Gk. alabastros (earlier albatos) "vase for perfumes," perhaps from Egyptian 'a-labaste "vessel of the goddess Bast."

Perhaps from an old name for Egypt (Khemia, lit. "land of black earth," found in Plutarch), or from Gk. khymatos "that which is poured out," from khein "to pour," related to khymos "juice, sap" [Klein, citing W. Muss-Arnolt, calls this folk etymology]. The word seems to have elements of both origins.Mahn ... concludes, after an elaborate investigation, that Gr. khymeia was probably the original, being first applied to pharmaceutical chemistry, which was chiefly concerned with juices or infusions of plants; that the pursuits of the Alexandrian alchemists were a subsequent development of chemical study, and that the notoriety of these may have caused the name of the art to be popularly associated with the ancient name of Egypt. [OED]The al- is the Arabic definite article, "the." The art and the name were adopted by the Arabs from Alexandrians and thence returned to Europe via Spain. Alchemy was the "chemistry" of the Middle Ages and early modern times; since c.1600 the word has been applied distinctively to the pursuit of the transmutation of baser metals into gold, which, along with the search for the universal solvent and the panacea, were the chief occupations of early chemistry.

Cf. sense evolution of gate. Applied by c.1500 to "long narrow enclosure for playing at bowls, skittles, etc." Used in place names from c.1500.  The word is applied in Amer.Eng. to what in London is called a mews, and also is used there especially of a back-lane parallel to a main street (1729). To be up someone's alley "in someone's neighborhood" (literally or figuratively) is from 1931; alley-cat attested by 1890.
alligator	ˈælɪˌgeɪtə	1560s, lagarto (modern form attested from 1620s, with excrescent -r as in tater, feller, etc.), a corruption of Sp. el lagarto (de Indias) "the lizard (of the Indies)," from L. lacertus (see lizard).

Altered in Medieval Latin by influence of amandus "loveable," and acquiring in French an excrescent -l- perhaps from Sp. almendra "almond," which got it via confusion with the Arabic definite article al-, which formed the beginnings of many Spanish words. Applied to eyes shaped like almonds, especially of certain Asiatic peoples, from 1870.
alms	ɑ:mz	O.E. ælmesse "alms, almsgiving," from P.Gmc. *alemosna (cf. O.S. alamosna, O.H.G. alamuosan, O.N. ölmusa), an early borrowing of V.L. *alemosyna (cf. O.Sp. almosna, O.Fr. almosne, It. limosina), from Church L. eleemosyna (Tertullian, 3c.), from Gk. eleemosyne "pity, mercy," in Ecclesiastical Greek "charity, alms," from eleemon "compassionate," from eleos "pity, mercy," of unknown origin, perhaps imitative of cries for alms. Spelling perversion in Vulgar Latin is perhaps by influence of alimonia.

altar	ˈɔ:ltə	O.E. alter, altar, from L. altare (pl. altaria) "high altar, altar for sacrifice to the great gods," perhaps originally meaning "burnt offerings" (cf.

Apparently suggested to Comte by French legal phrase l'autrui, or in full, le bien, le droit d'autrui. The -l- is perhaps a reinsertion from the Latin word.  There is a fable that when the badger had been stung all over by bees, a bear consoled him by a rhapsodic account of how he himself had just breakfasted on their honey. The badger replied peevishly, "The stings are in my flesh, and the sweetness is on your muzzle." The bear, it is said, was surprised at the badger's want of altruism.

Either the State for ever, crushing individual and local life, taking over in all fields of human activity, bringing with it its wars and its domestic struggles for power, its palace revolutions which only replace one tyrant by another, and inevitably at the end of this development there is ... death! Or the destruction of States, and new life starting again in thousands of centers on the principle of the lively initiative of the individual and groups and that of free agreement. The choice lies with you! [Prince Peter Kropotkin (1842-1921)]

Enke "ankle"); the second element in the Old English, Old Norse and Old Frisian forms perhaps suggests claw (cf.

asparagus	əˈspærəgəs	late O.E. sparage, from L. asparagus (in M.L. often sparagus), from Gk. asparagos, of uncertain origin; probably from PIE root *sp(h)er(e)g- "to spring up" (though perhaps from a non-Greek source). In Middle English, asperages sometimes was regarded as a plural, with false singular aspergy. By 16c. the word had been anglicized as far as sperach, sperage. It was respelled by c.1600 to conform with classical Latin, but then folk-etymologized formation sparrowgrass arose 17c., persisting into 19c., during which time asparagus had "an air of stiffness and pedantry" [John Walker, "Critical Pronouncing Dictionary," 1791].

Another theory holds it to be from Gk. a- "not" + *sphaltos "able to be thrown down," taken as verbal adj. of sphallein "to throw down," in reference to a use of the material in building.

Originally identical with astronomy, it had also a special sense of "practical astronomy, astronomy applied to prediction of events." This was divided into natural astrology "the calculation and foretelling of natural phenomenon" (tides, eclipses, etc.), and judicial astrology "the art of judging occult influences of stars on human affairs" (also known as astromancy, 1650s). Differentiation between astrology and astronomy began late 1400s and by 17c. this word was limited to "reading influences of the stars and their effects on human destiny."

attorney	əˈtə:ni	early 14c. (mid-13c. in Anglo-Latin), from O.Fr. atorné "(one) appointed," pp. of aturner "to decree, assign, appoint," from atorner (see attorn). The legal Latin form attornare influenced the spelling in Anglo-French. The sense is of "one appointed to represent another's interests." In English law, a private attorney was one appointed to act for another in business or legal affairs (usually for pay); an attorney at law or public attorney was a qualified legal agent in the courts of Common Law who prepared the cases for a barrister, who pleaded them (the equivalent of a solicitor in Chancery). So much a term of contempt in England that it was abolished by the Judicature Act of 1873 and merged with solicitor.Johnson observed that "he did not care to speak ill of any man behind his back, but he believed the gentleman was an attorney." [Boswell]The double -t- is a mistaken 15c. attempt to restore a non-existent Latin original. Attorney general first recorded 1530s in sense of "legal officer of the state" (late 13c. in Anglo-French), from French, hence the odd plural (subject first, adjective second).

"a rubbing against," noun of action from pp. stem of atterere "to wear, rub away," figuratively "to destroy, waste," from ad- "to" (see ad-) + terere "to rub" (see throw). The earliest sense in English is from Scholastic theology (late 14c.), "sorrow for sin merely out of fear of punishment," a minor irritation, and thus less than contrition. The sense of "wearing down of military strength" is a World War I coinage (1914). Figurative use by 1930.

auction	ˈɔ:kʃən	"a sale by increase of bids," 1590s, from L. auctionem (nom. auctio) "an increasing sale, auction, public sale," noun of action from pp. stem of augere "to increase," from PIE root *aug- "to increase" (see augment).

Arnold, "An Archaeology of the Early Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms," 1988, p.36]  Another word for "barn" in O.E. was beretun, "barley enclosure" (from tun "enclosure, house"), which accounts for the many Barton place names on the English map, and the common surname.

"raging warrior of superhuman strength;" probably from *ber- "bear" + serkr "shirt," thus lit. "a warrior clothed in bearskin." Thus not from O.N. berr "bare, naked."  Thorkelin, in the essay on the Berserkir, appended to his edition of the Krisini Saga, tells that an old name of the Berserk frenzy was hamremmi, i.e., strength acquired from another strange body, because it was anciently believed that the persons who were liable to this frenzy were mysteriously endowed, during its accesses, with a strange body of unearthly strength. If, however, the Berserk was called on by his own name, he lost his mysterious form, and his ordinary strength alone remained. ["Notes and Queries," Dec. 28, 1850]   The adjectival use probably is from such phrases as berserk frenzy, or as a title (Arngrim the Berserk).

bevy	ˈbevi:	early 15c., collective noun of quails and ladies, from Anglo-Fr. bevée, of unknown origin. One supposed definition of the word is "a drinking bout," but this is perhaps a misprint of bever, from O.Fr. beivre (see beverage).

bilious	ˈbɪljəs	1540s, "pertaining to bile, biliary," from Fr. bilieux, from L. biliosus "pertaining to bile," from bilis (see bile). Meaning "wrathful, peevish, ill-tempered" (as people afflicted with an excess of bile were believed to be) is attested from 1560s. This is the main modern sense in English and French; the more literal meaning being taken up by biliary. Related: Biliousness.

Meaning "bunch of birch twigs used for flogging" (1640s) led to verb meaning "to flog" (1830). Related: Birched; birching. Birch beer is by 1827, Amer.Eng.
biting	ˈbaɪtɪŋ	"small piece," c.1200, from related O.E. words bite "act of biting," and bita "piece bitten off," are probably the source of the modern words meaning "boring-piece of a drill" (1590s), "mouthpiece of a horse's bridle" (mid-14c.), and "a piece bitten off, morsel" (c.1000). All from P.Gmc. *biton (cf. O.S. biti, O.N. bit, O.Fris. bite, M.Du. bete, O.H.G. bizzo "biting," Ger. Bissen "a bite, morsel"), from PIE root *bheid- "to split" (see fissure). Meaning "small piece, fragment" is from c.1600. Sense of "short space of time" is 1650s. Theatrical bit part is from 1909. Money sense in two bits, six bits, etc. is originally from Southern U.S. and West Indies, in reference to silver wedges cut or stamped from Spanish dollars (later Mexican reals); transferred to "eighth of a dollar."
bizarre	biˈzɑ:	1640s, from Fr. bizarre "odd, fantastic" (16c.), originally "handsome, brave," perhaps from Basque bizar "a beard" (the notion being of bearded Spanish soldiers making a strange impression on the French); alternative etymology traces it to It. bizarro "angry, fierce, irascible," from bizza "fit of anger."
blab	blæb	mid-15c., apparently from M.E. noun blabbe "one who does not control his tongue" (late 13c.), probably echoic. Related: Blabbed; blabbing. The exact relationship between the blabs and blabber is difficult to determine. The noun was "[e]xceedingly common in 16th and 17th c.; unusual in literature since c 1750" [OED]. 
blackmail	ˈblækmeil	1852, from blackmail (n.). Related: Blackmailed; blackmailing.
blade	bleid	O.E. blæd "a leaf," but also "a leaf-like part" (of spade, oar, etc.), from P.Gmc. *bladaz (cf. O.Fris. bled "leaf," Ger. blatt, O.S., Dan., Du. blad, O.N. blað), from PIE *bhle-to-, suffixed form (p.p.) of *bhel- (3) "to thrive, bloom," possibly identical with *bhel- (2) "to blow, swell" (see bole). Extended in M.E. to shoulders (c.1300) and swords (early 14c.). The modern use in reference to grass may be a M.E. revival, by influence of O.Fr. bled "corn, wheat" (11c., perhaps from Germanic). The cognate in German, Blatt, is the general word for "leaf;" Laub is used collectively as "foliage." O.N. blað was used of herbs and plants, lauf in reference to trees. This might have been the original distinction in Old English, too. Of men from 1590s; in later use often a reference to 18c. gallants, but the original exact sense, and thus signification, is uncertain.
blame	bleim	early 13c., from O.Fr. blasme "blame, reproach; condemnation," a back formation from blasmer (see blame (v.)).
blanch	blæntʃ	"to start back, turn aside," 1570s, variant of blench. Related: Blanched; blanching.
bland	blænd	1660s, from It. blando "delicate," or O.Fr. bland "flattering, complimentary," both from L. blandus "smooth-talking, flattering, alluring," perhaps from PIE *mlad-, nasalized variant of *meld-, extended form of root *mel- (see melt). Related: Blandly; blandness. Latin also had blandiloquentulus "flattering in speech," which might have yielded a useful English *blandiloquent.
blandish	ˈblændɪʃ	"flattering speech," 1590s, from blandish + -ment. Sense of "attraction, allurement" (often blandishments) is from 1590s.

Meaning "empty space" (in a document, etc.) is from c.1570. Meaning "losing lottery ticket" (1560s) is behind the expression draw a blank. The word has been "for decorum's sake, substituted for a word of execration" [OED] from 1854. From 1896 as short for blank cartridge (itself from 1826).
blare	bleə	late 14c., bleren "to wail," possibly from an unrecorded O.E. *blæren, or from M.Du. bleren "to bleat, cry, bawl, shout." Probably echoic, either way. Related: Blared; blaring. As a noun from 1809, from the verb.
blarney	ˈblɑ:ni:	1796, from Blarney Stone (which is said to make a persuasive flatterer of any who kiss it), in a castle near Cork, Ireland; reached wide currency through Lady Blarny, the smooth-talking flatterer in Goldsmith's "Vicar of Wakefield" (1766). As a verb from 1803.

Second element is pheme "utterance" (see fame); first element uncertain, perhaps related to blaptikos "hurtful," though blax "slack (in body and mind), stupid" also has been suggested.
blast	blɑ:st	O.E. blæst "blowing, breeze, puff of wind," from P.Gmc. *bles- (cf. O.N. blastr, O.H.G. blast "a blowing, blast," Ger. blasen, Goth. blesan "to blow"), from PIE *bhle- "to blow," probably a variant of root *bhel- (2) "to blow, inflate, swell" (see bole). Meaning "explosion" is from 1630s; that of "noisy party, good time" is from 1953, Amer.Eng. slang. Sense of "strong current of air for iron-smelting" (1690s) led to blast furnace and transferred sense in full blast "the extreme" (1839). Blast was the usual word for "a smoke of tobacco" c.1600.
blatant	ˈbleitənt	1596, in blatant beast, coined by Edmund Spenser in "The Faerie Queen" to describe a thousand-tongued monster representing slander; probably suggested by L. blatire "to babble."

O.S. blek, O.N. bleikr, Du. bleek, O.H.G. bleih, Ger. bleich "pale;" O.N. bleikja, Du. bleken, Ger. bleichen "to bleach"), from PIE root *bhel- (1) "to shine, flash, burn" (cf. Skt. bhrajate "shines;" Gk. phlegein "to burn;" L. flamma "flame," fulmen "lightning," fulgere "to shine, flash," flagrare "to burn;" O.C.S. belu "white;" Lith. balnas "pale"). The same root probably produced black; perhaps because both black and white are colorless, or because both are associated with burning. Related: Bleached; bleaching.
bleachers	ˈbli:tʃəz	1540s, "one who bleaches," agent noun from bleach (v.). The "bench for spectators at a sports field" sense (usually bleachers) is attested since 1889, Amer.Eng.; so named because the boards were bleached by the sun.
bleak	bli:k	c.1300, "pale," from O.N. bleikr "pale, whitish, blond," from P.Gmc. *blaika- "shining, white," from PIE root *bhel- (1) "to shine, flash, burn" (see bleach (v.)). Later "bare, windswept" (1530s). Sense of "cheerless" is c.1719 figurative extension. The same Germanic root produced O.E. blac "pale," but this died out, probably from confusion with blæc "black;" however bleak persisted, with a sense of "bare" as well as "pale."
blemish	ˈblemɪʃ	1520s, from blemish (v.).
blench	blentʃ	O.E. blencan "deceive, cheat," from P.Gmc. *blenk- "to shine, dazzle, blind," from PIE root *bhel- (1) "to shine, flash, burn" (see bleach). Sense of "move suddenly, wince, dodge" is from c.1300. Related: Blenched; blenching.

blizzard	ˈblɪzəd	"strong, sustained snowstorm," 1859, origin obscure (perhaps somehow connected with blaze (1)); it came into general use in the U.S. in this sense the hard winter 1880-81. OED says it probably is "more or less onomatopœic," and adds "there is nothing to indicate a French origin." Before that it typically meant "violent blow," also "hail of gunfire" in American English from 1829, and blizz "violent rainstorm" is attested from 1770. The winter storm sense perhaps is originally a colloquial figurative use in the Upper Midwest of the U.S. 
bloat	bləʊt	1860 as a disease of livestock, from bloat (v.). Meaning "bloatedness" is from 1905.
bloated	ˈbləʊtɪd	"overgrown," 1660s, pp. adjective from bloat (v.). Figurative sense by 1711.

blotch	blɔtʃ	1799, from blotch + -y (2). Related: Blotchiness.
blotto	ˈblɔtəʊ	"drunk," c.1905, from some signification of blot (v.) in its "soak up liquid" meaning.
blowhard	ˈbləʊˌhɑ:d	also blow-hard, 1840, a sailor's word (from 1790 as a nickname for a sailor), perhaps not originally primarily meaning "braggart;" from blow (v.1) + hard (adv.). An adjective sense of "boastful" appeared c.1855, and may be a separate formation leading to a modified noun use.
blueprint	ˈblu:ˈprint	also blue-print, 1882, from blue (1) + print (n.). The process uses blue on white, or white on blue. Figurative sense of "detailed plan" is attested from 1926. As a verb by 1939.
bluff	blʌf	"broad, vertical cliff," 1680s, from bluff (adj.) "with a broad, flat front" (1620s), a sailors' word, probably from Du. blaf "flat, broad." Apparently a North Sea nautical term for ships with flat vertical bows, later extended to landscape features.

blunt	blʌnt	street slang for "marijuana and tobacco cigar" (easier to pass around, easier to disguise, and the stimulant in the tobacco enhances the high from the pot) surfaced c.1993, but is said to have originated among Jamaicans in New York City in the early 1980s; from Phillies Blunt brand cigars; see blunt (adj.), which has been used of certain cigars since 19c.Users say that the Phillies Blunt brand produces less harsh-tasting or sweeter smoke. The leaf wrapper of a Phillies Blunt is strong enough to hold together through the manipulations of making a blunt. Other brands fall apart. [http://nepenthes.lycaeum.org/Drugs/THC/Smoke/blunts.html]
blur	blə:	1580s, and thus probably from blur (n.), but the dates are close and either might be the original. Related: Blurred; blurring.

bode	bəʊd	O.E. bodian "proclaim, announce; foretell," from boda "messenger," probably from P.Gmc. *budon- (cf. O.S. gibod, Ger. gebot, O.N. boð), from PIE *bheudh- "be aware, make aware" (cf. bid). As a shortened form of forebode (usually evil), it dates from 1740. Related: Boded; boding.
bodyguard	ˈbɔdi:ˌgɑ:d	1735, "retinue, escort," collective singular, from body + guard. Attested 1861 as "a soldier of the bodyguard."
boggle	ˈbɔgəl	1590s, "to start with fright" (as a startled horse does), from M.E. bugge "specter" (among other things, supposed to scare horses at night); see bug; also cf. bogey (1). The meaning "to raise scruples, hesitate" is from 1630s. Related: Boggled; boggling.
bogus	ˈbəʊgəs	1838, "counterfeit money, spurious coin," Amer.Eng., apparently from a slang word applied (according to some sources first in Ohio in 1827) to a counterfeiter's apparatus.  One bogus or machine impressing dies on the coin, with a number of dies, engraving tools, bank bill paper, spurious coin, &c. &c. making in all a large wagon load, was taken into possession by the attorney general of Lower Canada. [Niles' Register, Sept. 7, 1833, quoting from Concord, N.H., "Statesman," Aug. 24]   Some trace this to tantrabobus, also tantrabogus, a late 18c. colloquial Vermont word for any odd-looking object, in later 19c. use "the devil," which might be connected to tantarabobs, recorded as a Devonshire name for the devil. Others trace it to the same source as bogey (1).
boisterous	ˈbɔɪstərəs	late 15c., unexplained alteration of M.E. boistous (c.1300) "rough, coarse (as of food), clumsy, violent," of unknown origin, perhaps from Anglo-Fr. bustous "rough (road)," which is perhaps from O.Fr. boisteos "curved, lame; uneven, rough" (Mod.Fr. boiteux), itself of obscure origin. Another guess traces it via Celtic to L. bestia. Used of persons from 1560s. Related: Boisterously; boisterousness.
bold	bəuld	O.E. beald (W.Saxon), bald (Anglian) "bold, brave, confident, strong," from P.Gmc. *balthaz (cf. O.H.G. bald "bold, swift," in names such as Archibald, Leopold, Theobald; Goth. balþei "boldness;" O.N. ballr "frightful, dangerous"), perhaps from PIE *bhol-to- suffixed form of *bhel- (2) "to blow, swell" (see bole). Old French and Provençal baut "bold," Italian baldo "bold, daring, fearless" are Germanic loan-words.
bolster	ˈbəʊlstə	mid-15c. (implied in bolstered), "propped up, made to bulge" (originally of a woman's breasts), from bolster (n.). Figurative sense is from c.1500, on the notion of "to support with a bolster, prop up." Related: Bolstering.
bolt	bəult	O.E. bolt "short, stout arrow with a heavy head;" also "crossbow for throwing bolts," from P.Gmc. *bultas (cf. O.N. bolti, Dan. bolt, Du. bout, Ger. Bolzen), perhaps from PIE root *bheld- "to knock, strike" (cf. Lith. beldu "I knock," baldas "pole for striking"). Applied since M.E. to other short metal rods (especially those with knobbed ends). From the notion of an arrow's flight comes the lightning bolt (1530s). A bolt of canvas (c.1400) was so called for its shape. Adverbial phrase bolt upright is from late 14c.
bolted	null	"enclosure for animals," O.E. penn, penne, "enclosure," perhaps related to O.E. pinn "pin, peg" (see pin) on notion of a bolted gate or else "structure made of pointed stakes." The verb, "to enclose in a pen" is attested from c.1200. Slang noun meaning "prison" (1884) is shortening of penitentiary (q.v.), but earlier use (1845) is probably a fig. extension of this word.

bonnet	ˈbɔnɪt	late 14c., Scottish bonat "brimless hat for men," from O.Fr. bonet, short for chapel de bonet, from bonet (12c., Mod.Fr. bonnet) "kind of cloth used as a headdress," from M.L. bonitum "material for hats," perhaps aphetic of L.L. abonnis "a kind of cap" (7c.), which is perhaps from a Germanic source. 
bonny	ˈbɔni:	1540s, of unknown origin, apparently from O.Fr. bon, bone "good" (see bon).
bonus	ˈbəunəs	1773, "Stock Exchange Latin" [Weekley], from L. bonus "good" (adj.); see bene-. The correct noun form would be bonum. In U.S. history the bonus army was tens of thousands of World War I veterans and followers who marched on Washington, D.C., in 1932 demanding early redemption of their service bonus certificates (which carried a maximum value of $625).
boon	bu:n	in boon companion (1560s), only real survival of M.E. boon "good" (early 14c.), from O.Fr. bon (see bon).

booth	bu:ð	mid-12c., from O.Dan. boþ "temporary dwelling," from E.Norse *boa "to dwell," from P.Gmc. *bowan-, from PIE root *bheue- "to be, exist, grow" (see be). See also bound (adj.2). Cf. Ger. Bude "booth, stall," M.Du. boode, Lith. butas "house," O.Ir both "hut," Boh. bouda, Pol. buda, some probably borrowed from E.Norse, some formed from the PIE root.
booze	bu:z	by 1768, "to drink a lot" (v.), variant of M.E. bouse (c.1300), from M.Du. busen "to drink heavily," related to M.H.G. bus (intrans.) "to swell, inflate," of unknown origin. The noun is recorded by 1821, perhaps 1714; reinforced by name of Philadelphia distiller E.G. Booze. Boozy (1719) was one of Benjamin Franklin's 225 synonyms for "drunk," published in 1722. In New Zealand from c.WWII, a drinking binge was a boozeroo.

O.E. beorg "hill," Welsh bera "stack, pyramid," Skt. bhrant-, Avestan brzant- "high," Gk. Pergamos, name of the citadel of Troy).  In German and Old Norse, chiefly as "fortress, castle;" in Gothic, "town, civic community." Meaning shifted M.E. from "fortress," to "fortified town," to simply "town" (especially one possessing municipal organization or sending representatives to Parliament). In U.S. (originally Pennsylvania, 1718) often an incorporated town; in Alaska, however, it is the equivalent of a county. The Scottish form is burgh. The O.E. dative singular byrig is found in many place names as -bury.
bosom	ˈbuzəm	O.E. bosm "breast; womb; surface; ship's hold," from W.Gmc. *bosm- (cf. O.Fris. bosm, O.S. bosom, M.Du. boesem, Du. boezem, O.H.G. buosam, Ger. Busen "bosom, breast"), perhaps from PIE root *bhou- "to grow, swell," or *bhaghus "arm" (in which case the primary notion would be "enclosure formed by the breast and the arms"). Narrowed meaning "a woman's breasts" is from 1959; but bosomy "big-breasted" is from 1928. Bosom-friend is attested 1580s; bosom buddy from 1920s.
bossy	ˈbɔ:si:	1540s, "swelling, projecting and rounded, decorated with bosses" from boss (2). Meaning "domineering, fond of ordering people about" is recorded 1882, from boss (1). As a common cow name it represents L. bos "cow."

boudoir	ˈbu:ˌdwɑ:	1777, "room where a lady may retire to be alone," from Fr. boudoir (18c.), lit. "pouting room," from bouder "to pout, sulk," which, like pout, probably ultimately is imitative of puffing.
bough	baʊ	O.E. bog "shoulder, arm," extended O.E. to "twig, branch" (cf. limb), from P.Gmc. *bogaz (cf. O.N. bogr "shoulder," O.H.G. buog, Ger.

O.Ir. bolg "bag," Bret. bolc'h "flax pod"), from PIE *bhelgh- (see belly). Modern financial meaning (1733) is from notion of treasury minister keeping his fiscal plans in a wallet. The verb in this sense is from 1884. Related: Budgeted; budgeting. Another 18c. transferred sense was to "a bundle of news," hence the use of the word as the title of some newspapers.
buff	bʌf	1570s, buffe leather, from M.Fr. buffle "buffalo" (15c., via It. from L. bufalus; see see buffalo). The color term comes from the hue of buffalo hides (later ox hides); association of "hide" and "skin" led c.1600 to in the buff, and use of buff or suede to polish metal led to sense of verb "to polish with a buff" (1885).

bug	bʌɡ	"insect," 1620s (earliest reference is to bedbugs), probably from M.E. bugge "something frightening, scarecrow" (late 14c.), a meaning obsolete except in bugbear (1570s) and bugaboo (q.v.); probably connected with Scot. bogill "goblin, bugbear," or obsolete Welsh bwg "ghost, goblin" (cf. Welsh bwgwl "threat," earlier "fear"). Cf. also bogey (1) and Ger. bögge, böggel-mann "goblin." Perhaps influenced in meaning by O.E. -budda used in compounds for "beetle" (cf. Low Ger. budde "louse, grub," M.L.G. buddech "thick, swollen"). Meaning "defect in a machine" (1889) may have been coined c.1878 by Thomas Edison (perhaps with the notion of an insect getting into the works).

bulletin	ˈbulitin	1765, from Fr. bulletin (16c.), modeled on It. bulletino, dim. of bulletta "document, voting slip," itself a dim. of L. bulla (see bull (2)). The word was used earlier in English in the Italian form (mid-17c.). Popularized by their use in the Napoleonic Wars as the name for dispatches sent from the front meant for the home public (which led to the proverbial expression as false as a bulletin). Bulletin board is from 1831.
bullion	ˈbʊljən	early 15c., "uncoined gold or silver," from Anglo-Norm. bullion "bar of precious metal," also "place where coins are made, mint," perhaps, through the notion of "melting," from O.Fr. boillir "to boil," from L. bullire "boil." But perhaps it is rather from O.Fr. bille "stick, block of wood."
bully	ˈbuli	1530s, originally "sweetheart," applied to either sex, from Du. boel "lover, brother," probably dim. of M.H.G. buole "brother," of uncertain origin (cf. Ger. buhle "lover"). Meaning deteriorated 17c. through "fine fellow," "blusterer," to "harasser of the weak" (1680s, from bully-ruffian, 1650s). Perhaps this was by influence of bull (n.1), but a connecting sense between "lover" and "ruffian" may be in "protector of a prostitute," which was one sense of bully (though not specifically attested until 1706). The verb is first attested 1710.

bumble	ˈbʌmbəl	"to flounder, blunder," 1530s, probably of imitative origin.
bumper	ˈbʌmpə	1670s, "glass filled to the brim;" perhaps from notion of bumping as "large," or from a related sense of "booming" (see bump). Meaning "anything unusually large" is from 1759, slang. Meaning "buffer of a car" is from 1839, Amer.Eng., originally in reference to railway cars; 1926 of automobiles.
bumpkin	ˈbʌmpkɪn	"awkward country fellow," 1560s, probably from M.Du. bommekijn "little barrel," dim. of boom "tree." Apparently, though itself Dutch, it began as a derogatory reference to Dutch people as short and dumpy.
bumpy	ˈbʌmpi:	1865, from bump + -y (2).  Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night. [Bette Davis ("Margo Channing"), "All About Eve," 1950]  Related: Bumpiness.

As a verb meaning "to bulge out," from late 14c. The noun sense of "cluster" is mid-15c.; connection with the earlier sense is obscure, and this may be a separate word, perhaps through O.Fr. bouge (2), 15c., from Flemish boudje dim. of boud "bundle." The verb meaning "to gather up in a bunch" (trans.) is from 1828; that of "to crowd together" (intrans.) is from 1873. Related: Bunched; bunching.
bundle	ˈbʌndl	1620s, from bundle (n.); meaning "to wrap up in warm heavy clothes" is from 1893. Related: Bundled. Bundling (1781) "sharing a bed for the night, fully dressed, wrapped up with someone of the opposite sex" was a former local custom in Wales and New England.
bungle	ˈbʌŋgəl	1520s, origin obscure, perhaps a mix of boggle and bumble, or more likely from a Scandinavian word akin to Swed. bangla "to work ineffectually," from O.Swed. bunga "to strike" (cf. Ger. Bengel "cudgel," also "rude fellow"). Related: Bungled; bungler; bungling.
buoy	ˈbu:i:	1570s, perhaps from Sp. boyante, prp. of boyar "to float," from boya "buoy," from Du. boei (see buoy). Of personalities, etc., from c.1748.

burial	ˈberiəl	"act of burying," late 13c.; earlier "tomb" (c.1200), false singular from O.E. byrgels "tomb," from byrgan "to bury" + suffix -els; a compound also found in O.S. burgisli, suggesting a P.Gmc. *burgisli-, from PIE *bhergh- "to hide, protect" (see bury). The Germanic suffix *-isli- (cf. O.E. hydels "hiding place," fætels "bag") became obsolete and was felt as a plural of the Latin-derived suffix -al forming nouns of action from verbs (survival, approval, etc.).
burlesque	bəˈlesk	1660s, "derisive imitation, grotesque parody," from Fr. burlesque (16c.), from It. burlesco, from burla "joke, fun, mockery," possibly ultimately from L.L. burra "trifle, nonsense," lit.

The verb sense of "to burst" is first attested 1806; the slang meaning "demote" (especially in a military sense) is from 1918; that of "arrest" is from 1953 (earlier "to raid" from Prohibition). Originally "frolic, spree;" sense of "sudden failure" is from 1842. Phrase ______ or bust as an emphatic expression attested by 1851 in British depictions of Western U.S. dialect. Probably from earlier expression bust (one's) boiler, by late 1840s, a reference to steamboat boilers exploding when driven too hard.
bustle	ˈbʌsl	"padding in a skirt," 1788, perhaps from Ger. Buschel "bunch, pad," or may be a special use of bustle (1) with ref. to "rustling motion."
buttress	ˈbʌtrɪs	early 14c., from O.Fr. botrez "flying buttress," lit. "buttressed," pl. of boteret "support," from bouter "to thrust against," of Frankish origin (cf. O.N. bauta "to strike, beat"), from P.Gmc. *butan, from PIE root *bhau- "to strike" (see butt (v.)). The verb is from late 14c.

cactus	ˈkæktəs	c.1600, from L. cactus "cardoon," from Gk. kaktos, name of a type of prickly plant of Sicily (the Spanish artichoke), perhaps of pre-Hellenic origin. Modern meaning is 18c., because Linnaeus gave the name to a group of plants he thought were related to this but are not.
cadaver	kəˈdævə	c.1500, from L. cadaver "dead body (of men or animals)," probably from a perf. part. of cadere "to fall, sink, settle down, decline, perish" (see case (1)). Cf. Gk. ptoma "dead body," lit. "a fall;" poetic English the fallen "those who died in battle."

Arabic also used the word in the sense "mold for casting bullets," which is the original literal meaning in English, though the earliest cited sense is a figurative one.

The Gk. measure was the equivalent of the Roman siliqua, which was one-twentyfourth of a golden solidus of Constantine; hence the word took on a sense of "a proportion of one twentyfourth" and became a measure of gold purity (1550s). Eighteen carat gold is eighteen parts gold, six parts alloy. It is unlikely that the classical carat was ever a measure of weight for gold.

"... English writers often erroneously spell it chaperone, app. under the supposition that it requires a fem. termination."

Vulgate also sometimes translated agape by L. dilectio, noun of action from diligere "to esteem highly, to love" (see diligence). Wyclif and the Rhemish version regularly rendered the Vulgate dilectio by 'love,' caritas by 'charity.' But the 16th c. Eng. versions from Tindale to 1611, while rendering agape sometimes 'love,' sometimes 'charity,' did not follow the dilectio and caritas of the Vulgate, but used 'love' more often (about 86 times), confining 'charity' to 26 passages in the Pauline and certain of the Catholic Epistles (not in I John), and the Apocalypse .... In the Revised Version 1881, 'love' has been substituted in all these instances, so that it now stands as the uniform rendering of agape. [OED]
charlatan	ˈʃɑ:lətən	1610s, from Fr. charlatan (16c.), from It. ciarlatano "a quack," from ciarlare "to prate, babble," from ciarla "chat, prattle," perhaps imitative of ducks' quacking. Related: Charlatanism.

chasm	ˈkæzəm	1590s, "deep crack in the earth," from L. chasma, from Gk. khasma "yawning hollow, gulf," related to khaskein "to yawn," and thus to chaos. In English in 17c. often spelled chasma.

Popularized in France 1831 through Cogniard's vaudeville "La Cocarde Tricolore." Meaning extended to "sexism" via male chauvinism (1969). The name is a French form of L. Calvinus and thus Calvinism and chauvinism are, etymologically, twins.
check	tʃek	late 14c., in chess; see check (n.). All the other senses seem to have developed from this one: "To arrest, stop," late 14c.; "to hold in restraint" (1620s); "to hold up or control" (an assertion, a person, etc.) by comparison with some authority or record, 1690s (as a player in chess limits his opponent's ability to move when he places his opponent's king in check).

The rhetorical meaning evolved in English through "series of steps by which a goal is achieved," to "escalating steps," to (1789) "high point," a usage credited by the OED to "popular ignorance."

cloak	kləuk	late 13c., from O.N.Fr. cloque (O.Fr. cloche) "travelling cloak," from M.L. clocca "travelers' cape," lit. "a bell," so called from the garment's bell-like appearance (see bell; the word is thus a doublet of clock). Cloak and dagger (1806) translates Fr. de cape et d'épée.

"The cobbler should stick to his last" (ne sutor ultra crepidam) is from the anecdote of Greek painter Apelles.   On one occasion a cobbler noticed a fault in the painting of a shoe, and remarking upon it to a person standing by, passed on. As soon as the man was out of sight Apelles came from his hiding-place, examined the painting, found that the cobbler's criticism was just, and at once corrected the error. ... The cobbler came by again and soon discovered that the fault he had pointed out had been remedied; and, emboldened by the success of his criticism, began to express his opinion pretty freely about the painting of the leg! This was too much for the patience of the artist, who rushed from his hiding place and told the cobbler to stick to his shoes. [William Edward Winks, "Lives of Illustrious Shoemakers," London, 1883]  [The quote is variously reported: Pliny ("Natural History" XXXV.x.36) has ne supra crepidam judicaret, while Valerius Maximus (VIII.xiii.3) gives supra plantam ascendere vetuit.]

conservative	kənˈsə:vətiv	late 14c., conservatyf, from M.Fr. conservatif, from L.L. conservativus, from L. conservatus, pp. of conservare (see conserve). As a modern political tradition, conservatism traces to Edmund Burke's opposition to the French Revolution (1790), but the word conservative is not found in his writing. It was coined by his French disciples, (e.g. Chateaubriand, who titled his journal defending clerical and political restoration "Le Conservateur"). Conservative as the name of a British political faction first appeared in an 1830 issue of the "Quarterly Review," in an unsigned article sometimes attributed to John Wilson Croker. It replaced Tory (q.v.) by 1843, reflecting both a change from the pejorative name (in use for 150 years) and repudiation of some reactionary policies. Extended to similar spirits in other parties from 1845.Strictly speaking, conservatism is not a political system, but rather a way of looking at the civil order. The conservative of Peru ... will differ greatly from those of Australia, for though they may share a preference for things established, the institutions and customs which they desire to preserve are not identical. [Russell Kirk (1918-1994)] Phrases such as a conservative estimate make no sense etymologically. The noun is attested from 1831, originally in the British political sense.

cosmos	ˈkɔzməs	c.1200 (but not popular until 1848, as a translation of Humboldt's Kosmos), from Gk. kosmos "order, good order, orderly arrangement," a word with several main senses rooted in those notions: The verb kosmein meant generally "to dispose, prepare," but especially "to order and arrange (troops for battle), to set (an army) in array;" also "to establish (a government or regime);" "to deck, adorn, equip, dress" (especially of women). Thus kosmos had an important secondary sense of "ornaments of a woman's dress, decoration" (cf. kosmokomes "dressing the hair") as well as "the universe, the world." Pythagoras is said to have been the first to apply this word to "the universe," perhaps originally meaning "the starry firmament," but later it was extended to the whole physical world, including the earth. For specific reference to "the world of people," the classical phrase was he oikoumene (ge) "the inhabited (earth)." Septuagint uses both kosmos and oikoumene. Kosmos also was used in Christian religious writing with a sense of "worldly life, this world (as opposed to the afterlife)," but the more frequent word for this was aion, lit. "lifetime, age."

crestfallen	ˈkrestˌfɔ:lən	1580s, pp. adj., but crestfall (v.) is recorded only from 1610s, in ref. to diseased horses, and is rare. It's possible that the image behind the use of the word is of horses, not cocks as often is asserted.
crevice	ˈkrevɪs	mid-14c., from O.Fr. crevace (12c., Mod.Fr. crevasse) "gap, rift, crack" (also, vulgarly, "the female pudenda"), from V.L. *crepacia, from L. crepare "to crack, creak;" meaning shifted from the sound of breaking to the resulting fissure.

Meaning "people acting or working together" is first attested 1560s. "Gang of men on a warship" is from 1690s.

The insects (Kermes vermilio) were gathered commercially in Mediterranean countries and sold throughout Europe. Kermes dyes have been found in burial wrappings in Anglo-Scandinavian York. It fell out of use with the introduction of cochineal: The dyes were comparable in quality and color intensity, but ten to twelve times as much kermes was needed to produce the same effect as cochineal. As a verb, from c.1600.
cringe	krɪndʒ	early 13c., from causative of O.E. cringan "give way, fall (in battle), become bent," from P.Gmc. *krank- "bend, curl up" (cf. O.N. kringr, Du. kring, Ger. Kring "circle, ring"). Related: Cringed; cringing. As a noun from 1590s.

Meaning "swindler" is Amer.Eng., 1879, from crooked in figurative sense of "dishonest" (1708). Crook "dishonest trick" was in M.E.
crooked	ˈkrukid	late O.E., "twisted, crooked, wry," from O.N. rangr, earlier *wrangr "crooked, wry, wrong," from P.Gmc. *wrangaz (cf.

The meaning "decisive, critical" (1830) is extended from a logical term, Instantias Crucis, adopted by Francis Bacon (1620); the notion is of cross fingerboard signposts at forking roads, thus a requirement to choose.

O.Ir. dith "end, death," O.C.S. daviti, Rus. davit' "to choke, suffer").

Languages usually don't borrow words from abroad for central life experiences, but "die" words are an exception, since they are often hidden or changed euphemistically out of superstitious dread.

dingy	ˈdɪŋi:	1736, Kentish dialect, "dirty," of uncertain origin, but perhaps related to dung. The noun dinge (1816) is a back formation.

Diversity as a virtue in a nation is an idea from the rise of modern democracies in the 1790s, where it kept one faction from arrogating all power (but this was not quite the modern sense, as ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, etc. were not the qualities in mind):  The dissimilarity in the ingredients which will compose the national government, and still more in the manner in which they will be brought into action in its various branches, must form a powerful obstacle to a concert of views in any partial scheme of elections. There is sufficient diversity in the state of property, in the genius, manners, and habits of the people of the different parts of the Union, to occasion a material diversity of disposition in their representatives towards the different ranks and conditions in society.

The diminutive winged beings so-called in children's stories seem to date from early 17c.  Yet I suspect that this flower-and-butterfly minuteness was also a product of rationalization, which transformed the glamour of Elfland into mere finesse, and invisibility into a fragility that could hide in a cowslip or shrink behind a blade of grass. It seems to become fashionable soon after the great voyages had begun to make the world seem too narrow to hold both men and elves; when the magic land of Hy Breasail in the West had become the mere Brazils, the land of red-dye-wood. [J.R.R. Tolkien," On Fairy-Stories," 1947]   The slang meaning "effeminate male homosexual" is first recorded 1895. Fairy ring is from 1590s.

Felge "plowed-up fallow land," E.Fris. falge "fallow," falgen "to break up ground"), perhaps from a derivation of PIE root *pel- "to turn," assimilated in English to fallow (adj.) because of the color of plowed earth.

felicity	fɪˈlɪsɪti:	late 14c., from O.Fr. felicite (14c.) "happiness," from L. felicitatem (nom. felicitas) "happiness, fertility," from felix (gen. felicis) "happy, fortunate, fruitful, fertile," from L. root *fe-, equivalent of PIE *dhe(i)- "to suck, suckle, produce, yield" (see fecund).
feline	ˈfi:ˌlaɪn	1680s, from L.L. felinus "of or belonging to a cat," from L. feles (gen. felis) "cat, wild cat, marten," of uncertain origin. As a noun, from 1861.
fell	fel	"cruel," late 13c., from O.Fr. fel "cruel, fierce, vicious," from M.L. fello "villain" (see felon). Phrase at one fell swoop is from "Macbeth."
felon	ˈfelən	late 13c., from O.Fr. felon "evil-doer, scoundrel, traitor, rebel, the Devil" (9c.), from M.L. fellonem (nom. fello) "evil-doer," of uncertain origin, perhaps from Frank. *fillo, *filljo "person who whips or beats, scourger" (cf. O.H.G. fillen "to whip"); or from L. fel "gall, poison," on the notion of "one full of bitterness." Another theory (advanced by Professor R. Atkinson of Dublin) traces it to L. fellare "to suck" (see fecund), which had an obscene secondary meaning in classical Latin (well-known to readers of Martial and Catullus), which would make a felon etymologically a "cock-sucker." OED inclines toward the "gall" explanation, but finds Atkinson's "most plausible" of the others.
felony	ˈfeləni:	late 13c. as a term in common law, in Anglo-Fr., from O.Fr. felonie (12c.) "wickedness, evil, treachery, perfidy, crime, cruelty, sin," from Gallo-Rom. *fellonia, from fellonem (see felon).
feminine	ˈfeminin	mid-14c., "of the female sex," from O.Fr. femenin (12c.) "feminine, female; with feminine qualities, effeminate," from L. femininus "feminine" (in the grammatical sense at first), from femina "woman, female," lit. "she who suckles," from root of felare "to suck, suckle" (see fecund). Sense of "woman-like, proper to or characteristic of women" is recorded from mid-15c. The interplay of meanings now represented in female, feminine, and effeminate, and the attempt to make them clear and separate, has led to many coinages: feminitude (1878); feminile feminine (1640s); feminility womanliness (1838); femality (17c., effeminacy; 1754 female nature). Also feminality (1640s, quality or state of being female), from rare adj. feminal (late 14c.), from O.Fr. feminal. And femineity quality or state of being feminine, from L. femineus of a woman, pertaining to a woman.
feminist	ˈfeminist	1894, from Fr. féministe (1872); cf. feminism.
fencer	ˈfensə
fencing	ˈfensiŋ	mid-15c., defending, act of protecting; 1580s in the sword-fighting sense; noun from prp. of fence (v.). In spite of the re-enactment in 1285 of the Assize of Arms of 1181, fencing was regarded as unlawful in England. The keeping of fencing schools was forbidden in the City of London, "as fools who delight in mischief do learn to fence with buckler, and thereby are encouraged in their follies." Meaning putting up fences is from 1620s; that of an enclosure is from 1580s; meaning receiving stolen goods is from 1851; meaning "materials for an enclosure" is from 1856.
fender	ˈfendə	late 13c., shortening of defender. Used of attachments to boats at first, of fireplaces since 1680s; application to automobiles is 1919.
ferment	fəˈment	late 14c., from O.Fr. fermenter (13c.) and directly from L. fermentare "to leaven, ferment," from fermentum "substance causing fermentation, leaven," from root of fervere "to boil, seethe" (see brew). Figurative use from 1650s. Related: Fermented; fermenting. As a noun, early 15c., from M.Fr. ferment, from L. fermentum. Figurative sense of "anger, passion" is from 1670s.
fermentation	ˌfɜ:mənˈteɪʃən	late 14c., in alchemy, with a broad sense; modern scientific sense is from c.1600; from L.L. fermentationem (nom. fermentatio), noun of action from fermentare (see ferment). Figurative use attested from 1650s.
fern	fɜ:n	O.E. fearn, from P.Gmc. *farnan (cf. O.S. farn, M.Du. vaern, Du. varen, O.H.G. farn, Ger. Farn), from PIE *porno-, a root which has yielded words for "feather, wing" (cf. Skt. parnam "feather;" Lith. papartis "fern;" Russ. paporot; Gk. pteris "fern," pteron "feather"), from root *per- (see petition). Applied to the plant perhaps from the feather-like appearance of the fronds. The plant's ability to appear as if from nothing accounts for the ancient belief that fern seeds conferred invisibility.
ferocious	fəˈrəuʃəs	1640s, from L. ferocis, oblique case of ferox "fierce, wild-looking" (see ferocity). Related: Ferociously; ferociousness.
ferocity	fəˈrɔsɪti:	c.1600, from Fr. férocité, from L. ferocitatem (nom. ferocitas) "fierceness," from ferocis, oblique case of ferox "wild, bold, courageous, warlike, fierce," lit. "wild-looking," a derivative of ferus "wild" (see fierce) + -ox, -ocem (gen. -ocis), a suffix meaning "looking or appearing" (cognate with Gk. ops "eye, sight").
ferret	ˈferɪt	late 14c., from O.Fr. furet, dim. of fuiron "weasel, ferret," lit. "thief," probably from L.L. furionem (related to furonem "cat," also "robber"), from L. fur (gen. furis) "thief." The verb (early 15c.) refers to the use of half-tame ferrets to kill rats and flush rabbits from burrows; the extended sense of "search out, discover" is 1570s. Related: Ferreted; ferreting.
ferrous	ˈferəs	"pertaining to or containing iron," 1865, from L. ferreus "made of iron," from ferrum "iron" (see ferro-). In chemistry, "containing iron," especially with a valence of two.
ferry	ˈferi	mid-15c., "a passage over a river;" see ferry (v.). The modern noun use (1580s) is a shortening of ferry boat (mid-15c.).
fertile	ˈfə:tail	mid-15c., from M.Fr. fertil and directly from L. fertilis "bearing in abundance, fruitful, productive," from ferre "to bear" (see infer). Fertile Crescent (1914) was coined by U.S. archaeologist James H. Breasted (1865-1935).
fertility	fəˈtɪlɪti:	early 15c., from M.Fr. fertilité, from L. fertilitatem (nom. fertilitas) "fruitfulness, fertility," from fertilis (see fertile).
fervent	ˈfɜ:vənt	mid-14c., from O.Fr. fervent, from L. ferventem (nom. fervens) "boiling, hot, glowing," figuratively "violent, impetuous, furious," prp. of fervere "to boil, glow," from PIE root *bhreue- (see brew). The figurative sense of "impassioned" is first attested c.1400. Related: Fervency; fervently.
fervor	ˈfɜ:və	mid-14c., "warmth or glow of feeling," from O.Fr. fervor (Mod.Fr. ferveur) "heat, enthusiasm, ardor, passion," from L. fervor "a boiling, violent heat; passion, ardor, fury," from fervere "to boil" (see brew).
festal	ˈfestəl	late 15c., from M.Fr. festal, from L.L. festalis, from L. festum "feast" (see feast).
fester	ˈfestə	late 14c., from O.Fr. festre "small sore discharging pus," from L. fistula "pipe, ulcer" (see fistula). The noun is from c.1300. Related: Festered; festering.
festive	ˈfestɪv	1650s, pertaining to a feast, from L. festivus "festive, joyous, gay," from festum festival, holiday, neut. of adj. festus (see feast).  Meaning mirthful is attested by 1774. Unattested from 1651 to 1735; modern use may be a back formation from festivity. Related: Festively; festiveness.
fete	feɪt	1754, from Fr. fête "festival, feast," from O.Fr. feste (see feast). Apparently first used in English by Horace Walpole (1717-1797). The verb is from 1819. Related: Feted; fetes; feting. 
fetid	ˈfetɪd	early 15c., from L. fetidus (commonly, but incorrectly, foetidus) "stinking," from fetere "have a bad smell, stink." Perhaps connected with fimus "dung," or with fumus "smoke."
fetish	ˈfetɪʃ	1801, "worship of fetishes;" in the purely psycho-sexual sense first recorded 1897 in writings of Henry Havelock Ellis (1859-1939), from fetish + -ism. In certain perversions of the sexual instinct, the person, part of the body, or particular object belonging to the person by whom the impulse is excited, is called the fetish of the patient. [E. Morselli in "Baldwin Dictionary of Philosophy," 1901] Related: Fetishist (1845; psycho-sexual sense from 1897).
fetter	ˈfetə	c.1300, from O.E. gefetrian (see fetter (n.)). Related: Fettered; fettering.
fettered	null	c.1300, from O.E. gefetrian (see fetter (n.)). Related: Fettered; fettering.
fetus	ˈfi:təs	late 14c., "the young while in the womb or egg," from L. fetus (often, incorrectly, foetus) "the bearing, bringing forth, or hatching of young," from Latin base *fe- "to generate, bear," also "to suck, suckle" (see fecund). In Latin, fetus sometimes was transferred figuratively to the newborn creature itself, or used in a sense of "offspring, brood" (cf. Horace's "Germania quos horrida parturit Fetus"), but this was not the basic meaning. Also used of plants, in the sense of "fruit, produce, shoot." The spelling foetus is sometimes attempted as a learned Latinism, but it is not historic.
feud	fju:d	c.1300, fede "enmity, hatred, hostility," northern English and Scottish; perhaps from an unrecorded O.E. word or else from O.Fr. fede, from O.H.G. fehida "contention, quarrel, feud," from P.Gmc. *faihitha noun of state from adj. *faiho- (cf. O.E. fæhð "enmity," fah "hostile;" Ger. Fehde "feud;" O.Fris. feithe "enmity;" see foe). Sense of "vendetta" is early 15c. Alteration of spelling in 16c. is unexplained. As a verb, from 1670s. Related: Feuded; feuding.
feverish	ˈfi:vərɪʃ	late 14c., "causing fever;" 1630s, excited; 1640s, having symptoms of fever, from fever + -ish. Earlier in same sense was feverous (late 14c.). Related: Feverishly; feverishness.
fiasco	fi:ˈæskəʊ	1855, theater slang for "a failure," by 1862 acquired the general sense of any dismal flop, on or off the stage. Via Fr. phrase fiare fiasco "turn out a failure" (19c.), from It. far fiasco "suffer a complete breakdown in performance," lit. "make a bottle," from fiasco "bottle," from L.L. flasco, flasconem (see flask). The reason for all this is utterly obscure today, but "the usual range of fanciful theories has been advanced" [Ayto]. Weekley finds it utterly mysterious and compares Fr. ramasser un pelle "to come a cropper (in bicycling), lit. to pick up a shovel." OED makes nebulous reference to "alleged incidents in Italian theatrical history." Klein suggests Venetian glass-crafters tossing aside imperfect pieces to be made later into common flasks. But according to an Italian dictionary, fare il fiasco used to mean "to play a game so that the one that loses will pay the fiasco," in other words, he will buy the next bottle (of wine). That plausibly connects the word with the notion of "a costly mistake."
fiat	ˈfi:ət	"authoritative sanction," 1630s, from L. fiat "let it be done" (also used in the opening of M.L. proclamations and commands), third person singular present subjunctive of fieri, used as passive of facere "to make, do" (see factitious). Also sometimes a reference to fiat lux "let there be light" in the Book of Genesis.
fickle	ˈfɪkəl	c.1200, probably from O.E. ficol "deceitful, cunning, tricky," related to befician "deceive," and to facen "deceit, treachery." Common Germanic (cf. O.S. fekan "deceit," O.H.G. feihhan "deceit, fraud, treachery"), from PIE *peig- "evil-minded, treacherous, hostile" (cf. L. piget "it irks, troubles, displeases," piger "reluctant, lazy"). Sense of "changeable" is first recorded late 13c. Related: Fickleness.
fictitious	fɪkˈtɪʃəs	1610s, "artificial, counterfeit," from M.L. fictitus, a misspelling of L. ficticius "artificial, counterfeit," from fictus "feigned, fictitious, false," pp. of fingere (see fiction). Related: Fictitiously.
fidelity	fiˈdeliti	early 15c., from M.Fr. fidélité (15c.), from L. fidelitatem (nom. fidelitas) "faithfulness, adherence," from fidelis "faithful, true," from fides "faith" (see faith).
fidget	ˈfɪdʒɪt	1670s, as the fidget "uneasiness," later the fidgets, from a 16c. verb fidge "move restlessly," perhaps from M.E. fiken "to fidget, hasten," from O.N. fikjask "to desire eagerly" (cf. Ger. ficken "to move about briskly;" see fuck). The verb fidget is first attested 1670s (implied in fidgetting). Related: Fidgeted.
fidgety	null	1730s, from fidget + -y (2).
fief	fi:f	also feoff, 1610s, from Fr. fief (12c.) "possession, holding, domain," a variant of O.Fr. fieu "fee" (see fee).
fiend	fi:nd	O.E. feond "enemy, foe," originally prp. of feogan "to hate," from P.Gmc. *fijæjan (cf. O.Fris. fiand "enemy," O.S. fiond, M.D. viant, Du. vijand "enemy," O.N. fjandi, O.H.G. fiant, Goth. fijands), from PIE root *pe(i)- "to blame, revile" (cf. Goth. faian "to blame;" see passion). As spelling suggests, it was originally the opposite of friend, but the word began to be used in O.E. for "Satan" (as the "enemy of mankind"), which shifted its sense to "diabolical person" (early 13c.). The old sense of the word devolved to foe, then to the imported word enemy. For spelling with -ie- see field. Meaning "devotee (of whatever is indicated)," e.g. dope fiend, is from 1865.
fiendish	ˈfi:ndɪʃ	1520s, from fiend + -ish. Related: Fiendishly; fiendishness.
fierce	fiəs	mid-13c., "proud, noble, bold," from O.Fr. fers, nom. form of fer, fier "strong, overwhelming, violent, fierce, wild; proud, mighty, great, impressive" (Mod.Fr. fier "proud, haughty"), from L. ferus "wild, untamed," from PIE root *ghwer- "wild, wild animal" (cf. Gk. ther, O.C.S. zveri, Lith. zveris "wild beast"). Original English sense of "brave, proud" died out 16c., but caused the word at first to be commonly used as an epithet, which accounts for the rare instance of a French word entering English in the nominative case. Meaning "ferocious, wild, savage" is from c.1300. Related: Fiercely; fierceness.
fiery	ˈfaiəri	late 13c., from M.E. fier "fire" (see fire (n.)) + -y (2). The spelling is a relic of one of the attempts to render O.E. "y" in fyr in a changing system of vowel sounds. Related: Fieriness.
fig	fɪg	early 13c., from O.Fr. figue (12c.), from O.Prov. figa, from V.L. *fica, from L. ficus "fig tree, fig," from a pre-I.E. Mediterranean language, possibly Semitic (cf. Phoenician pagh "half-ripe fig"). Earlier borrowed directly into O.E. from Latin as fic. A reborrowing of a word that had been taken directly from Latin as O.E. fic. The insulting sense of the word in Shakespeare, etc. (A fig for ...) is 1570s, in part from fig as "small, valueless thing," but also from Greek and Italian use of their versions of the word as slang for "cunt," apparently because of how a ripe fig looks when split open [Rawson, Weekley]. Giving the fig (Fr. faire la figue, Sp. dar la higa) was an indecent gesture of ancient provenance, made by putting the thumb between two fingers or into the mouth, with the intended effect of the modern gesture of "flipping the bird" (see bird (3)). See sycophant. Use of fig leaf in figurative sense of "flimsy disguise" (1550s) is from Gen. iii.7.
figment	ˈfɪgmənt	early 15c., from L. figmentum "something formed or fashioned, creation," related to figura "shape" (see figure (n.)).
figurative	ˈfɪgjərətɪv	late 14c., from O.Fr. figuratif "metaphorical," from L.L. figurativus, from figurat-, pp. stem of figurare (see figure). Of speech, language, etc., "involving figures of speech," from 1845. Related: Figuratively. 
figurehead	ˈfɪgjəˌhed	1765, from figure + head. Originally the ornament on the bow of a ship; sense of "leader without real authority" is first attested 1883.
figurine	ˌfɪgjəˈri:n	1854, from Fr. figurine (16c.), from It. figurina, dim. of figura, from L. figura (see figure (n.)).
filament	ˈfɪləmənt	1590s, from Mod.L. filamentum, from L.L. filare "to spin, draw out in a long line," from L. filum "thread" (see file (v.)).
filch	fɪltʃ	"steal," 1560s, slang, perhaps from c.1300 filchen "to snatch, take as booty," of unknown origin. Liberman says filch is probably from Ger. filzen "comb through." Related: Filched; filching.
file	fail	1520s, "string or wire on which documents are strung," from Fr. file "row," from M.Fr. filer (see file (v.)). The meaning "arranged collection of papers" is from 1620s; computer sense is from 1954. The military sense "line or row of men" (1590s) is from the French verb in the sense of "spin out (thread); march in file." 
filet	fɪˈleɪ	1841 in cookery, reborrowing from French of the same word that had been taken 14c. and anglicized as fillet (q.v.). Filet mignon is attested as a French word in English from 1815. The 'Chateaubriand,' the 'entrecôte,' and the 'filet mignon' (of mutton), with other forms, are all due to the more enlarged sympathies of the French butcher for what is perfect. We must entirely change the mode of cutting up the carcase before we can arrive at the same perfection in form of meat purchasable, and as that is hopeless, so is it useless to insist further on the subject on behalf of the public. ["The Kitchen and the Cellar," "Quarterly Review," April 1877] 
filial	ˈfɪli:əl	late 14c., from M.Fr. filial, from L.L. filialis "of a son or daughter," from L. filius "son," filia "daughter," possibly from a suffixed form of PIE root *bheue- "to be, exist, grow" (see be), though *dhe(i)- "to suck, suckle" (see fecund) "is more likely" [Watkins].

filibuster	ˈfɪləˌbʌstə	1580s, flibutor "pirate," probably ultimately from Du. vrijbuiter "freebooter," used of pirates in the West Indies as Sp. filibustero and Fr. flibustier, either or both of which gave the word to Amer.Eng. (see freebooter). Used 1850s and '60s of lawless adventurers from the U.S. who tried to overthrow Central American countries. The legislative sense is first recorded c.1851, probably because obstructionist legislators "pirated" debate. Not technically restricted to U.S. Senate, but that's where the strategy works best. The verb is recorded by 1853 in both the freebooting and the legislative senses. Related: Filibustered; filibustering.
filigree	ˈfɪlɪˌgri:	1690s, shortening of filigreen (1660s), from Fr. filigrane "filigree" (17c.), from It. filigrana, from L. filum "thread" (see file (v.)) + granum "grain" (see corn (1)). Related: Filigreed.
fillet	ˈfɪlɪt	early 14c., "headband," from O.Fr. filet (12c.) "thread, filament; strip, ligament," dim. of fil "thread" (see file (v.)). Sense of "cut of meat or fish" is from late 14c., apparently so called because it was prepared by being tied up with a string. As a verb, from c.1600, "to bind with a narrow band;" meaning "to cut in fillets" is from 1846. Related: Filleted; filleting.
fillings	null
filter	ˈfiltə	1570s, from M.L. filtrare, from filtrum (see filter (n.)). The figurative sense is from 1830. Related: Filtered; filtering.
filth	filθ	O.E. fylð "uncleanness, impurity," from P.Gmc. *fulitho (cf. O.S. fulitha "foulness,, filth," Du. vuilte, O.H.G. fulida), noun derivative of *fulo- "foul" (see foul). A classic case of i-mutation.
filthy	ˈfɪlθi:	late 12c., fulthe, corrupt, sinful, from filth + -y (2). Meaning physically unclean is from late 14c. Meaning "morally dirty, obscene" is from 1530s.  In early use often hardly more emphatic than the mod. dirty; it is now a violent expression of disgust, seldom employed in polite colloquial speech. [OED]  Related: Filthiness.
finable	ˈfaɪnəbl	1810, from in- (1) "not, opposite of" + definable (see define). Related: Indefinably.
finale	fəˈnæli:	1783, borrowed as a musical term from It. finale "final," from L. finalis (see final). From 1724 as an Italian word in English. Figurative use by 1810.
finch	fɪntʃ	O.E. finc, from P.Gmc. *finkiz, *finkjon (cf. M.L.G., M.Du. vinke, Du. vink, O.H.G. finco, Ger. Fink), perhaps imitative of the bird's note (cf. Breton pint "chaffinch," Rus. penka "wren").
fine	fain	late 13c., "pay as a ransom or penalty," from fine (n.). Inverted meaning "to punish by a fine" is from 1550s. Related: Fined; fining.
finesse	fəˈnes	1520s, from M.Fr. finesse "fineness, subtlety," from O.Fr. fin "subtle, delicate" (see fine (adj.)). The verb is first attested 1746, originally as a term in whist. Related: Finessed; finessing.
finicky	ˈfɪnɪki:	1825, "dainty, mincing," from finical "too particular" (1590s), perhaps from fine (adj.) + -ical as in cynical, ironical. The -k- between the final -c- and a suffix beginning in -i, -y, or -e is an orthographic rule to mark the pronunciation of -c- as "k" (cf. picnicking, trafficking, panicky, shellacked).  
firefly	ˈfaɪəˌflaɪ	1650s, from fire + fly.
firmament	ˈfɜ:məmənt	mid-13c., from L. firmamentum "firmament," lit. "a support or strengthening," from firmus "firm" (see firm (adj.)), used in Vulgate to translate Gk. stereoma "firm or solid structure," which translated Heb. raqia, a word used of both the vault of the sky and the floor of the earth in the O.T., probably lit. "expanse," from raqa "to spread out," but in Syriac meaning "to make firm or solid," hence the erroneous translation.
fiscal	ˈfiskəl	1560s, "pertaining to public revenue," from M.Fr. fiscal, from L.L. fiscalis "of or belonging to the state treasury," from L. fiscus "treasury," originally "purse, basket made of twigs (in which money was kept)," of unknown origin. The general sense of "financial" (1865, Amer.Eng.) was abstracted from phrases like fiscal calendar, fiscal year. Related: Fiscally.
fishery	ˈfɪʃəri:	"business of fishing," 1670s; place where fish are caught, 1690s; see fish + -ery. Related: Fisheries.
fishy	ˈfɪʃi:	late 15c., from fish + -y (2). Sense of "shady, questionable" is first recorded 1840, perhaps from the notion of "slipperiness," or of giving off a bad odor. 
fissile	ˈfɪsəl	1660s, from L. fissilis "that which may be cleft or split," from fissus, pp. of findere (see fissure).
fissure	ˈfɪʃə	c.1400, from O.Fr. fissure (13c.) and directly from L. fissura "a cleft," from root of findere "to split, cleave," from PIE *bhi-n-d-, from root *bheid- "to split" (cf. Skt. bhinadmi "I cleave," O.H.G. bizzan "to bite," O.E. bita "a piece bitten off, morsel," O.N. beita "to hunt with dogs," beita "pasture, food").
fit	fit	1823, "the fitting of one thing to another," later (1831) "the way something fits." Originally "an adversary of equal power" (mid-13c.), obscure, possibly from O.E. fitt "a conflict, a struggle" (see fit (n.2)).
fitful	ˈfɪtfəl	used once by Shakespeare ("Macbeth," 1605) in sense of "characterized by fits," then revived by Scott (1810) with a sense of "shifting, changing." From fit (n.2) + -ful. Related: Fitfully; fitfulness.
fitting	ˈfitiŋ	1530s (adj.); c.1600 (n.), from prp. of fit (v.).
fixture	ˈfikstʃə	1590s, act of fixing, perhaps from fix on model of mixture. Meaning "anything fixed or securely fastened" is from 1812.
flabbergast	ˈflæbəˌgæst	1772, mentioned (with bored) in a magazine article as a new vogue word, perhaps from some dialect (in 1823 flabbergast was noted as a Sussex word), likely an arbitrary formation from flabby or flapper and aghast.
flabby	ˈflæbi:	1690s, variant of flappy, which is recorded in the sense of "softly fleshy" from 1590s; see flap. Related: Flabbily; flabbiness.
flaccid	ˈflæksɪd	1610s, from Fr. flaccide or directly from L. flaccidus "flabby," from flaccus "flabby, flap-eared," of uncertain origin (OED suggests it's onomatopoeic). Related: Flaccidly; flaccidity.
flag	flæɡ	"cloth ensign," late 15c., now in all modern Germanic languages, but apparently first recorded in English, origin unknown, but likely connected with flag (v.) or else, like it, perhaps onomatopoeic. A less likely guess is that it is from the flag in flagstone on notion of being square and flat. U.S. Flag Day (1894) is in reference to the adopting of the Stars and Stripes by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777.
flagellate	ˈflædʒəˌleɪt	1620s, from L. flagellatus, pp. of flagellare "to scourge, lash" (see flagellum). Related: Flagellated; flagellating. An earlier verb for this was flagellen (mid-15c.).
flagrant	ˈfleɪgrənt	c.1500, "resplendent," from L. flagrantem (nom. flagrans) "burning, blazing, glowing," figuratively "glowing with passion, eager, vehement," prp. of flagrare "to burn, blaze, glow" from L. root *flag-, corresponding to PIE *bhleg- "to shine, flash, burn" (cf.

The noun is first attested 1540s, from the verb, with the meaning "stroke of wit." It's possible that the original word was imitative, along the lines of flip (v.), but there seems to be some influence from flit, such as in the flirt sense of "to move in short, quick flights," attested from 1580s.

L. porca "ridge between two furrows," O.Ir. -rech, Welsh rhych "furrow"). "Some scholars connect this word with L. porcus, Eng. FARROW, assigning to the common root the sense 'to root like a swine.'

fury	ˈfjuəri	late 14c., "fierce passion," from O.Fr. furie (14c.), from L. furia "violent passion, rage, madness," related to furere "to rage, be mad." Romans used Furiæ to translate Gk. Erinyes, the collective name for the avenging deities sent from Tartarus to punish criminals (in later accounts three in number and female). Hence, figuratively, "an angry woman" (late 14c.).
fuse	fju:z	"combustible cord or tube for lighting an explosive device," also fuze, 1640s, from It. fuso "spindle" (so called because the originals were long, thin tubes filled with gunpowder), from L. fusus "spindle," of uncertain origin. Influenced by Fr. fusée "spindleful of hemp fiber," and obsolete English fusee "musket fired by a fuse." Meaning "device that breaks an electrical circuit" first recorded 1884, so named for its shape, but erroneously attributed to fuse (v.) because it melts.
fusillade	ˈfju:səˌlɑ:d	"simultaneous discharge of firearms," 1801, from Fr. fusillade, from fusiller "to shoot," from fusil "musket" (see fusilier). As a verb from 1816.

First attested in Anglo-Irish writers, but no obvious connections to Irish. The verb is first attested 1792, from the noun. Related: Fussed; fussing. To make a fuss was earlier to keep a fuss (1726).
fussy	ˈfʌsi:	1831, from fuss + -y (2). Related: Fussily; fussiness.
fustian	ˈfʌstʃən	"thick cotton cloth," c.1200, from O.Fr. fustaigne, from M.L. fustaneum, probably from L. fustis "staff, stick of wood," probably a loan-translation of Gk. xylina lina "linens of wood" (i.e. "cotton"), but the M.L. word also is sometimes said to be from Fostat, town near Cairo where this cloth was manufactured. [Klein finds this derivation untenable.] Figurative sense of "pompous, inflated language" recorded by 1590s.
futile	ˈfju:tail	1550s, from M.Fr. futile, from L. futilis "vain, worthless, futile," lit. "pouring out easily" (of a vessel), hence "easily emptied, leaky, unreliable," from base of fundere "pour, melt," from PIE root *gheu- "to pour" (see found (2)). Related: Futilely.
futility	fju:ˈtɪlətɪ	1620s, from Fr. futilité or directly from L. futilitatem (nom. futilitas) "worthlessness," from futilis (see futile). Hence, jocular futilitarian (1827).

gadfly	ˈgædˌflaɪ	1620s, "fly which bites cattle," probably from gad (n.) "goad, metal rod," here in the sense of "stinger;" but the sense is entangled with gad (v.) and another early meaning of gadfly was "someone who likes to go about, often stopping here and there" (1610s). Sense of "one who irritates another" is from 1640s (equivalent of L. oestrus).
gadget	ˈgædʒɪt	1886, gadjet (but said to date back to 1850s), sailors' slang word for any small mechanical thing or part of a ship for which they lacked, or forgot, a name; perhaps from Fr. gâchette "catchpiece of a mechanism" (15c.), dim. of  gâche "staple of a lock."
gaffe	gæf	"blunder," 1909, perhaps from Fr. gaffe "clumsy remark," originally "boat hook," from M.Fr. gaffe (15c.), from O.Prov. gaf, probably from W.Goth. *gafa "hook," from P.Gmc. *gafa. Sense connection is obscure; the gaff was used to land big fish. Or it may derive from British slang gaff "to cheat, trick" (1893); or gaff "criticism" (1896), from Scottish dialect sense of "loud, rude talk" (see gaff (2)).

[Chaucer, "House of Fame"] Astronomers began to speculate by mid-19c. that some of the spiral nebulae they could see in telescopes were actually immense and immensely distant structures the size and shape of the Milky Way. But the matter was not settled until the 1920s.
gale	ɡeil	"storm at sea," 1540s, from gaile "wind," origin uncertain, perhaps from O.N. gol "breeze," or O.Dan. gal "bad, furious" (often used of weather), from O.N. galinn "bewitched."

garbage	ˈɡɑ:bidʒ	early 15c., "giblets of a fowl, waste parts of an animal," later confused with garble in its sense of "siftings, refuse." Perhaps some senses derive from O.Fr. garbe "a bundle of sheaves, entrails," from P.Gmc. *garba- (cf. Du. garf, Ger. garbe "sheaf"), from PIE *ghrebh- "a handful, a grasp." Sense of "refuse, filth" is first attested 1580s; used figuratively for "worthless stuff" from 1590s. Garbology "study of waste as a social science" is from 1976.

gaucherie	ˌgəʊʃəˈri:	1798, from Fr. gaucherie, from gauche (see gauche).
gaudy	ˈgɔ:di:	"showy, tastelessly rich," 1580s, probably ultimately from M.E. gaudi "large, ornamental bead in a rosary" (early 14c.); but there is a parallel sense of gaudy as "full of trickery" (1520s), from M.E. gaud "deception, trick," from gaudi "a jest, trick," possibly from Anglo-Fr. gaudir "be merry, scoff," from L. gaudere "rejoice" (see joy). Alternative etymology of the adjective is from M.E. gaudegrene "yellowish-green" (early 14c.), originally "green dye" obtained from a plant formerly known as weld, from a Germanic source (see weld (n.)), which became gaude in Old French. The English term supposedly shifted sense from "weld-dye" to "bright." As a noun, "feast, festival" 1650s, from gaudy day "day of rejoicing" (1560s).

gauze	gɔ:z	1560s, gais, from Fr. gaze, conjectured to be from Arabic gazz "raw silk" [Barnhart], or from Gaza, Palestinian city associated with production of this fabric [Klein, Du Cagne].
gavel	ˈgævəl	"small mallet used by presiding officers at meetings," 1805, Amer.Eng., of unknown origin; perhaps connected with Ger. dial. gaffel "brotherhood, friendly society," from M.H.G. gaffel "society, guild," related to O.E. gafol "tribute," giefan "to give" (see habit). But in some sources gavel also is identified as a type of mason's tool, in which case the extended meaning may be via freemasonry. As a verb, by 1887, from the noun.
gay	ɡei	late 14c., "full of joy, merry; light-hearted, carefree;" also "wanton, lewd, lascivious" (late 12c. as a surname, Philippus de Gay), from O.Fr. gai "joyful, happy; pleasant, agreeably charming; forward, pert" (12c.; cf. O.Sp. gayo, Port. gaio, It. gajo, probably French loan-words). Ultimate origin disputed; perhaps from Frankish *gahi (cf. O.H.G. wahi "pretty"), though not all etymologists accept this. Meaning "stately and beautiful; splendid and showily dressed" is from early 14c. The word gay by the 1890s had an overall tinge of promiscuity -- a gay house was a brothel. The suggestion of immorality in the word can be traced back at least to the 1630s, if not to Chaucer:  But in oure bed he was so fressh and gay Whan that he wolde han my bele chose.  Slang meaning "homosexual" (adj.) begins to appear in psychological writing late 1940s, evidently picked up from gay slang and not always easily distinguished from the older sense:  After discharge A.Z. lived for some time at home. He was not happy at the farm and went to a Western city where he associated with a homosexual crowd, being "gay," and wearing female clothes and makeup. He always wished others would make advances to him. ["Rorschach Research Exchange and Journal of Projective Techniques," 1947, p.240]  The association with (male) homosexuality likely got a boost from the term gay cat, used as far back as 1893 in Amer.Eng. for "young hobo," one who is new on the road, also one who sometimes does jobs.  "A Gay Cat," said he, "is a loafing laborer, who works maybe a week, gets his wages and vagabonds about hunting for another 'pick and shovel' job. Do you want to know where they got their monica (nickname) 'Gay Cat'? See, Kid, cats sneak about and scratch immediately after chumming with you and then get gay (fresh). That's why we call them 'Gay Cats'." [Leon Ray Livingston ("America's Most Celebrated Tramp"), "Life and Adventures of A-no. 1," 1910]  Quoting a tramp named Frenchy, who might not have known the origin. Gay cats were severely and cruelly abused by "real" tramps and bums, who considered them "an inferior order of beings who begs of and otherwise preys upon the bum -- as it were a jackal following up the king of beasts" [Prof. John J. McCook, "Tramps," in "The Public Treatment of Pauperism," 1893], but some accounts report certain older tramps would dominate a gay cat and employ him as a sort of slave. In "Sociology and Social Research" (1932-33) a paragraph on the "gay cat" phenomenon notes, "Homosexual practices are more common than rare in this group," and gey cat "homosexual boy" is attested in N. Erskine's 1933 dictionary of "Underworld & Prison Slang" (gey is a Scottish variant of gay).  The "Dictionary of American Slang" reports that gay (adj.) was used by homosexuals, among themselves, in this sense since at least 1920. Rawson ["Wicked Words"] notes a male prostitute using gay in reference to male homosexuals (but also to female prostitutes) in London's notorious Cleveland Street Scandal of 1889. Ayto ["20th Century Words"] calls attention to the ambiguous use of the word in the 1868 song "The Gay Young Clerk in the Dry Goods Store," by U.S. female impersonator Will S. Hays, but the word evidently was not popularly felt in this sense by wider society until the 1950s at the earliest.  "Gay" (or "gai") is now widely used in French, Dutch, Danish, Japanese, Swedish, and Catalan with the same sense as the English. It is coming into use in Germany and among the English-speaking upper classes of many cosmopolitan areas in other countries. [John Boswell, "Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality," 1980]  Gay as a noun meaning "a (usually male) homosexual" is attested from 1971; in M.E. it meant "excellent person, noble lady, gallant knight," also "something gay or bright; an ornament or badge" (c.1400).
gaze	ɡeiz	1752, supposedly a facetious formation from gaze + -bo, Latin first person singular future tense suffix (cf. videbo "I shall see"), on model of earlier belvedere "cupola," from It. bello verde "handsome sight." But perhaps rather a corruption of some oriental word.

Of persons, from late 13c. Forms in -i-, -y- were lost early 14c., and the modern form of the word probably representing a M.E. borrowing from O.Fr. gemme (12c.). As a verb, from c.1600, "to adorn with gems;" mid-12c. as "to bud."
generate	ˈdʒenəreit	c.1500, "to beget" (offspring), a back formation from generation or else from L. generatus, pp. of generare "to beget, produce" (see generation); originally "to beget;" in reference to natural forces, conditions, substances, etc., attested from 1560s.

Secondary senses of "unselfish" (1690s) and "plentiful" (1610s) were present in French and in Latin. Related: Generously; generousness.
genesis	ˈdʒenɪsɪs	O.E. Genesis, first book of the Pentateuch, from L. genesis, adopted as title of first book of Old Testament in Vulgate, from Gk. genesis "origin, creation, generation," from gignesthai "to be born," related to genos "race, birth, descent" (see genus).

"(Gnarled) occurs in one passage of Shakes. (for which the sole authority is the folio of 1623), whence it came into general use in the nineteenth century" [OED].

gnome	nəʊm	"dwarf-like earth-dwelling spirit," 1712, from Fr. gnome, from Mod.L. gnomus, used 16c. in a treatise by Paracelsus, who gave the name pigmaei or gnomi to elemental earth beings, possibly from Gk. *genomos "earth-dweller" (cf. thalassonomos "inhabitant of the sea"). A less-likely suggestion is that Paracelsus based it on the homonym that means "intelligence" (preserved in gnomic). Popular in children's literature 19c. as a name for red-capped German and Swiss folklore dwarfs. Garden figurines first imported to England late 1860s from Germany.
gnomic	ˈnəʊmɪk	"full of instructive sayings," 1815, from Fr. gnomique (18c.) and directly from L.L. gnomicus "concerned with maxims, didactic," from Gk. gnomikos, from gnome "thought, opinion, maxim, intelligence," from root of gignoskein "to come to know" (see gnostic). English gnome meant "short, pithy statement of general truth" (1570s). Gnomical is attested from 1610s.
goad	gəʊd	O.E. gad "point, spearhead, arrowhead," from P.Gmc. *gaido (cf. Lombardic gaida "spear"), from PIE *ghei- (cf.

gosling	ˈgɔzlɪŋ	mid-14c. (late 13c. as a surname), from O.N. gæslingr, from gos "goose" (see goose) + dim. suffix. replaced O.E. gesling. The modern word may be a M.E. formation from M.E. gos "goose."
gospel	ˈɡɔspəl	O.E. godspel "gospel, glad tidings announced by Jesus; one of the four gospels," from god "good" (see good) + spel "story, message" (see spell (n.)); translation of L. bona adnuntiatio, itself a translation of Gk. euangelion "reward for bringing good news."  The first element of the O.E. word had a long "o," but it shifted under mistaken association with God. The word passed early from English to continental Germanic languages in forms that clearly indicate the first element had shifted to "God," e.g. O.S. godspell, O.H.G. gotspell, O.N. goðspiall. Used of anything as true as the Gospel from mid-13c. Gospel-gossip was Addison's word ("Spectator," 1711) for "one who is always talking of sermons, texts, etc."
gossamer	ˈgɔsəmə	c.1300, "spider threads spun in fields of stubble in late fall," apparently from gos "goose" + sumer "summer" (cf. Swed. sommertrad "summer thread"). The reference might be to a fancied resemblance of the silk to goose down, or because geese are in season then. The German equivalent mädchensommer (lit. "girls' summer") also has a sense of "Indian summer," and the English word originally may have referred to a warm spell in autumn before being transferred to a phenomenon especially noticable then. Cf. obsolete Scottish go-summer "period of summer-like weather in late autumn." Meaning "anything light or flimsy" is from c.1400. The adjective sense "filmy" is attested from 1802.

gourd	gɔ:d	c.1300, from Anglo-Fr. gourde, from O.Fr. coorde, ultimately from L. cucurbita "gourd," of uncertain origin, perhaps related to cucumis "cucumber."
gourmand	gʊəˈmɑ:nd	late 15c., "glutton," from M.Fr. gourmant "glutton," originally an adj., "gluttonous," of uncertain origin. Not connected with gourmet. Meaning "one fond of good eating" is from 1758.  The gourmand is one whose chief pleasure is eating; but a gourmet is a connoisseur of food and wines. In England the difference is this: a gourmand regards quantity more than quality, a gourmet quality more than quantity. [Brewer, "Dictionary of Phrase and Fable," Philadelphia, 1898] 
gourmet	gʊəˈmeɪ	"connoisseur in eating and drinking," 1820, from Fr. gourmet, altered (by influence of M.Fr. gourmant "glutton") from O.Fr. groume, originally "wine-taster, wine merchant's servant" (in 13c. "a lad generally"), of uncertain origin. As an adjective from 1900. Cf. gourmand.
governance	ˈgʌvənəns	late 14c., "act or manner of governing," from O.Fr. gouvernance "government, rule, administration; (rule of) conduct," from governer (see govern). Fowler writes that the word "has now the dignity of incipient archaism," but it might continue useful in its original sense as government comes primarily to mean "the governing power in a state."

heathen	ˈhi:ðən	O.E. hæðen "not Christian or Jewish," also as a noun, "heathen man" (especially of the Danes), merged with O.N. heiðinn (adj.) "heathen, pagan." Perhaps lit. "pertaining to one inhabiting uncultivated land," from heath + -en (2). But historically assumed to be from Goth. haiþno "gentile, heathen woman," used by Ulfilas in the first translation of the Bible into a Germanic language (cf. Mark vii:26, for "Greek"); if so it could be a derivative of Goth. haiþi "dwelling on the heath," but this sense is not recorded. It may have been chosen on model of L. paganus, with its root sense of "rural"  (see pagan), or for resemblance to Gk. ethne (see gentile), or it may be a literal borrowing of that Greek word, perhaps via Armenian hethanos [Sophus Bugge]. Like other basic words for exclusively Christian ideas (e.g. church) it likely would have come first into Gothic and then spread to other Germanic languages.

Related: Heckled; heckling.

helm	helm	mid-15c., perhaps a dim. of O.E. helm "protection, covering; crown, helmet" (see helm (2)). But Barnhart says from M.Fr. helmet (Mod.Fr. heaume), dim. of helme "helmet," from the same Germanic source as helm (2). "Middle English Dictionary" points to both without making a choice. "Old English helm never became an active term in the standard vocabulary of English." [Barnhart]

O.N. hemja "to bridle, curb," Swed. hämma "to stop, restrain," O.Fris. hemma "to hinder," M.Du., Ger. hemmen "to hem in, stop, hinder"), from PIE *kem- "to compress." Apparently the same root yielded O.E. hamm, common in place names (where it means "enclosure, land hemmed in by water or high ground, land in a river bend"). In M.E., hem also was a symbol of pride or ostentation.  If þei wer þe first þat schuld puplysch þese grete myracles of her mayster, men myth sey of hem, as Crist ded of þe Pharisees, þat þei magnified her owne hemmys.

As an "inventor" and adapter to general purposes of the tools used by navvies and hodmen, "Hooligan" is an Irish character who occupies week by week the front of a comic literary journal called Nuggets, one of the series of papers published by Mr. James Henderson at Red Lion House. Previous to publication in London, "Hooligan" appears, I believe, in New York in a comic weekly, and in London he is set off against "Schneider," a German, whose contrainventions and adaptations appear in the Garland (a very similar paper to Nuggets), which also comes from Mr. Henderson's office.

hurricane	ˈhʌrikən	1550s, a partially deformed adoptation from Sp. huracan (Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdés, "Historia General y Natural de las Indias," 1547-9), furacan (in the works of Pedro Mártir De Anghiera, chaplain to the court of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella and historian of Spanish explorations), from an Arawakan (W.

I recollect the chorus to a song at Kamtchatka was "Husky, Husky." ["Last of the Arctic Voyages," London, 1855] 
hustings	ˈhʌstɪŋz	O.E. husting "meeting, court, tribunal," from O.N. husðing "council," from hus "house" (see house) + ðing "assembly" (see thing); so called because it was a meeting of the men who formed the "household" of a nobleman or king. The native Anglo-Saxon word for this was folc-gemot. The plural became the usual form c.1500; sense of "temporary platform for political speeches" developed by 1719, apparently from London's Court of Hustings, presided over by the Lord Mayor, which was held on a platform in the Guildhall.

Increase of population, which is filling the States out to their very borders, together with a new and extended network of railroads and other avenues, and an internal commerce which daily becomes more intimate, is rapidly bringing the States into a higher and more perfect social unity or consolidation. Thus, these antagonistic systems are continually coming into closer contact, and collision results.   Shall I tell you what this collision means? They who think that it is accidental, unnecessary, the work of interested or fanatical agitators, and therefor ephemeral, mistake the case altogether. It is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces, and it means that the United States must and will, sooner or later, become either entirely a slaveholding nation, or entirely a free-labor nation.

jamboree	ˌdʒæmbəˈri:	1866, represented as typical of American English, perhaps from jam (n.) on pattern of shivaree [Barnhart]. For the second element, Weekley suggests Fr. bourree, a kind of rustic dance. Klein thinks the whole thing is of Hindu origin (but he credits its introduction to English, mistakenly, to Kipling). Boy Scouts use is from 1920.

See zeal. In biblical language (early 13c.) "tolerating no unfaithfulness."  Most of the words for 'envy' ... had from the outset a hostile force, based on 'look at' (with malice), 'not love,' etc. Conversely, most of those which became distinctive terms for 'jealousy' were originally used also in a good sense, 'zeal, emulation.' [Buck, pp.1138-9]  Among the ways to express this in other tongues are Swed. svartsjuka, lit. "black-sick," from phrase bara svarta strumpor "wear black stockings," also "be jealous." Dan. skinsyg "jealous," lit. "skin-sick," is from skind "hide, skin" said to be explained by Swedish dialectal expression fa skinn "receive a refusal in courtship."
jeer	dʒɪə	1550s, gyr, "to deride, to mock," of uncertain origin; perhaps from Du. gieren "to cry or roar," or Ger. scheren "to plague, vex," lit. "to shear."

jesuitical	null	1540s, from Mod.L. Jesuita, member of the Society of Jesus, founded 1533 by Ignatius Loyola to combat Protestantism. Their enemies (in both Catholic and Protestant lands) accused them of belief that ends justify means, hence the sense "a dissembling person" (1630s), and jesuitical "deceitful" (1610s).
jettison	ˈdʒetɪsən	1848, from jettison (n.) "act of throwing overboard" to lighten a ship. This noun was an 18c. Marine Insurance writers' restoration of the earlier form and original sense of the 15c. word that had become jetsam, probably because jetsam had taken on a sense of "things cast overboard" and an unambiguous word was needed for "act of throwing overboard." M.E. jetteson (n.) "act of throwing overboard" is from Anglo-Fr. getteson, from O.Fr. getaison "act of throwing (goods overboard)," especially to lighten a ship in distress, from L.L. iactionem (nom. iactatio) "act of throwing," noun of action from pp. stem of iectare "toss about" (see jet (v.)).

Most mysterious of all in the psychics of baseball is the "jinx," that peculiar "hoodoo" which affects, at times, a man, at other times a whole team. Let a man begin to think that there is a "jinx" about, and he is done for for the time being. ["Technical World Magazine," 1911]  The verb is 1912 in Amer.Eng., from the noun. Related: Jinxed; jinxing.

jog	dʒɔɡ	1540s, "to shake up and down," perhaps altered from M.E. shoggen "to shake, jolt, move with a jerk" (late 14c.), of uncertain origin.

The name is perhaps from slang jumbo "clumsy, unwieldy fellow" (1823), which itself is possibly from a word for "elephant" in a W.African language (cf. Kongo nzamba).  "I tell you conscientiously that no idea of the immensity of the animal can be formed. It is a fact that he is simply beyond comparison.

kangaroo	ˌkæŋgəˈru:	1770, used by Capt. Cook and botanist Joseph Banks, supposedly an aborigine word from northeast Queensland, Australia, usually said to be unknown now in any native language. However, according to Australian linguist R.M.W. Dixon ("The Languages of Australia," Cambridge, 1980), the word probably is from Guugu Yimidhirr (Endeavour River-area Aborigine language) /gaNurru/ "large black kangaroo."In 1898 the pioneer ethnologist W.E. Roth wrote a letter to the Australasian pointing out that gang-oo-roo did mean 'kangaroo' in Guugu Yimidhirr, but this newspaper correspondence went unnoticed by lexicographers. Finally the observations of Cook and Roth were confirmed when in 1972 the anthropologist John Haviland began intensive study of Guugu Yimidhirr and again recorded /gaNurru/.

kinetic	kɪˈnetɪk	"relating to motion," 1841, from Gk. kinetikos "moving, putting in motion," from kinetos "moved," verbal adjective of kinein "to move" (see cite).  Buster Keaton's subject was kinetic man, a being he approached with the almost metaphysical awe we reserve for a Doppelgänger. This being was, eerily, himself, played by himself, then later in a projection room, watched by himself: an experience never possible to any generation of actors in the previous history of the world. [Hugh Kenner, "The Counterfeiters," 1968]  Related: Kinetical; kinetically.

kitsch	kɪtʃ	1926, from Ger. kitsch, lit. "gaudy, trash," from dialectal kitschen "to smear."  What we English people call ugliness in German art is simply the furious reaction against what Germans call süsses Kitsch, the art of the picture postcard, and of what corresponds to the royalty ballad. It has for years been their constant reproach against us that England is the great country of Kitsch. Many years ago a German who loved England only too well said to me, 'I like your English word plain; it is a word for which we have no equivalent in German, because all German women are plain.' He might well have balanced it by saying that English has no equivalent for the word Kitsch. [Edward J. Dent, "The Music of Arnold Schönberg," "The Living Age," July 9, 1921] 
kitten	ˈkitn	late 14c., probably from an Anglo-French variant of O.Fr. chitoun (O.N.Fr. caton) "little cat," from chat "cat," from L.L. cattus (see cat). Applied playfully to a young girl, a sweetheart, from 1870.
kleptomania	ˌkleptəˈmeɪni:ə	1830, formed from mania + Gk. kleptes "thief," from kleptein "to steal, act secretly," from PIE *klep- "to steal," an extention of root *kel- "to cover, conceal" (see cell; cf. L. clepere "to steal, listen secretly to," O.Pruss. au-klipts "hidden," O.C.S. poklopu "cover, wrapping," Goth. hlifan "to steal," hliftus "thief"). Much-derided 19c. as a fancy term for old-fashioned thievery and an opportunity for the privileged to claim a psychological motive for criminal misbehavior.  There is a popular belief that some of the criminal laws under which the poor are rigorously punished are susceptible of remarkable elasticity when the peccadilloes of the rich are brought under judgment, and that there is some truth in the old adage which declares that "one man may steal a horse where another dare not look over the hedge." This unwholesome distrust is not likely to diminish if, in cases of criminal prosecutions where so-called respectable persons commit theft without sufficiently obvious motive for the act, they have their crime extenuated on the plea of kleptomania, as has recently occurred in several notable instances. ["Kleptomania," "The Lancet," Nov. 16, 1861] 
knack	næk	mid-14c., "deception, trick, device," of uncertain origin, probably from a Low German word meaning "a sharp sounding blow" (cf. M.E. knak, late 14c.; Ger. knacken "to crack"), of imitative origin. Sense of "special skill" is first recorded 1580s, if this is in fact the same word.

kneel	ni:l	O.E. cneowlian, from cneow (see knee); cf. M.L.G. knelen, M.Du. cnielen, Du. knielen Goth. knussjan. Past tense knelt is a modern formation (19c.) on analogy of feel/felt, etc. Related: Kneeling.

knowledgeable	ˈnɔlɪdʒəbəl	also knowledgable, c.1600, "capable of being known, recognizable" (a sense now obsolete), from knowledge in its Middle English verbal sense + -able. The modern sense of "having knowledge, displaying knowledge" is from 1829 and probably a new formation.
knuckle	ˈnʌkl	mid-14c., knokel "finger joint; any joint of the body, especially a knobby one; morbid lump or swelling;" common Germanic (cf. M.L.G. knökel, M.Du. cnockel, Ger. knöchel), lit. "little bone," a dim. of P.Gmc. root *knuck- "bone" (cf. Ger. Knochen "bone). As a verb from 1740, originally in the game of marbles. To knuckle down "apply oneself earnestly" is 1864 in Amer.Eng., extended from marbles (putting a knuckle on the ground in assuming the hand position preliminary to shooting); to knuckle under "submit, give in" is first recorded 1740, supposedly from the former more general sense of "knuckle" and here meaning "knee," hence "to kneel." The face-busting knuckle-duster is from 1858 (a duster was a type of protective coat worn by workmen).
kudos	ˈku:ˌdəʊz	"fame, renown," 1799, probably originally in university slang, from Gk. kydos "glory, fame," especially in battle, lit. "that which is heard of" (see caveat). A singular noun in Greek, but the final -s often is mistaken as a plural suffix in English, leading to the barbarous back-formation kudo (attested by 1936).

labyrinth	ˈlæbəˌrɪnθ	c.1400, laberynthe (late 14c. in Latinate form laborintus) "labyrinth, maze," figuratively "bewildering arguments," from L. labyrinthus, from Gk. labyrinthos "maze, large building with intricate passages," especially the structure built by Daedelus to hold the Minotaur near Knossos in Crete, from a pre-Greek language; perhaps related to Lydian labrys "double-edged axe," symbol of royal power, which fits with the theory that the labyrinth was originally the royal Minoan palace on Crete and meant "palace of the double-axe." Used in English for "maze" early 15c., and in figurative sense of "confusing state of affairs" (1540s).
lace	leis	c.1200, "fasten (clothing, etc.) with laces and ties;" see lace (n.). Also "tighten (a garment) by pulling its laces" (early 14c.).

Gk. lakis "tatter, rag," lakizein "to tear to pieces;" Rus. lochma "rag, tatter, scrap;" Albanian l'akur "naked"). Related: Lacerated; lacerating.

lachrymose	ˈlækrəˌməʊs	1660s, "tear-like," from L. lacrimosus "tearful, sorrowful, weeping," also "causing tears, lamentable," from lacrima "tear," a dialect-altered borrowing of Gk. dakryma "tear," from dakryein "to shed tears," from dakry "tear," from PIE *dakru-/*draku- (see tear (n.)). Meaning "given to tears, tearful" is first attested 1727; meaning "of a mournful character" is from 1822. The -d- to -l- alteration in Latin is the so-called "Sabine -L-," cf. L. olere "smell," from root of odor, and Ulixes, the Latin form of Greek Odysseus. The Medieval Latin practice of writing -ch- for -c- before Latin -r- also altered anchor, pulchritude, sepulchre. The -y- is pedantic, from belief in a Greek origin. M.E. had lacrymable "tearful" (mid-15c.).
lackadaisical	ˌlækəˈdeɪzɪkəl	1768 (Sterne), from interjection lackadaisy "alas, alack" (1748), an alteration of lack-a-day (1690s), from alack the day (1590s). Hence, "given to crying 'lack-a-day,' vapidly sentimental." Sense probably altered by influence of lax. Related: Lackadaisically.
lackey	ˈlæki:	1520s, "footman, running footman, valet," from M.Fr. laquais "foot soldier, footman, servant" (15c.), of unknown origin; perhaps from O.Prov. lacai, from lecai "glutton, covetous," from lecar "to lick." Alternative etymology is via French from Catalan alacay, from Arabic al-qadi "the judge." Yet another guess traces it through Sp. lacayo, from It. lacchè, from Mod.Gk. oulakes, from Turk. ulak "runner, courier." This suits the original sense better, but OED says It. lacchè is from French. Sense of "servile follower" appeared 1580s. As a political term of abuse it dates from 1939 in communist jargon.
lacklustre	ˈlækˌlʌstə	British English spelling of lackluster (q.v.); for spelling, see -re.

limber	ˈlɪmbə	"detachable forepart of a gun carriage," 1620s, from M.E. lymer (early 15c.), earlier lymon (c.1400), probably from O.Fr. limon "shaft," a word perhaps of Celtic origin, or possibly from Germanic and related to limb (n.1). Hence, limber (v.) "to attach a limber to a gun" (1843). Cf. related Sp. limon "shaft," leman "helmsman."
limbo	ˈlɪmbəʊ	"region supposed to exist on the border of Hell" reserved for pre-Christian saints (Limbus patrum) and unbaptized infants (Limbus infantum);" c.1300, from L. limbo, ablative of limbus "edge, border" (see limb (2)). It emerged from Latin in the ablative form from frequent use in phrases such as in limbo (patrum), etc. Figurative sense of "condition of neglect or oblivion" is from 1640s.
limerick	ˈlɪmərɪk	nonsense verse of five lines, 1896, perhaps from the county and city in Ireland, but if so the connection is obscure. Often (after OED's Murray) attributed to a party game in which each guest in turn made up a nonsense verse and all sang a refrain with the line "Will you come up to Limerick?" but he reported this in 1898 and earlier evidence is wanting. Or perhaps from Learic, from Edward Lear (1812-1888) English humorist who popularized the form. Earliest examples are in French, which further complicates the quest for the origin. OED's first record of the word is in a letter of Aubrey Beardsley. The place name is lit. "bare ground," from Ir. Liumneach, from lom "bare, thin." It was famous for hooks.
limn	lɪm	early 15c., "to illuminate" (manuscripts), altered from M.E. luminen, "to illuminate manuscripts" (late 14c.), from O.Fr. luminer "light up, illuminate," from L. luminare "illuminate, burnish," from lumen (gen. luminis) "radiant energy, light," related to lucere "to shine" (see light (n.)). Sense of "portray, depict" first recorded 1590s. Related: Limned.
limnetic	lɪmˈnetɪk
limousine	ˈlimuzi:n	1902, "enclosed automobile with open driver's seat," from Fr. limousine, from Limousin, region in central France, originally an adjective referring to its chief city, Limoges, from L. Lemovices, name of a people who lived near there, perhaps named in ref. to their elm spears or bows. The Latin adjective form of the name, Lemovicinus, is the source of Fr. Limousin. Modern automobile meaning evolved from perceived similarity of the car's profile to a type of hood worn by the inhabitants of that province. Since 1930s, synonymous in Amer.Eng. with "luxury car;" applied from 1959 to vehicles that take people to and from large airports. Limousine liberal first attested 1969.
limp	limp	1706, "flaccid, drooping," of obscure origin, perhaps related to limp (v.).

linear	ˈliniə	1640s, from Fr. linéaire, from from L. linearis "belonging to a line," from linea "string, line" (see line (n.)). Essentially the same word as lineal; "in L. linearis the original suffix -alis was dissimilated to -aris, but in Late Latin this rule was no longer productive and the formation or re-formation in -alis remained unchanged." [Barnhart]. Linear A and Linear B (1902-3) were names given to two related forms of linear Minoan writing discovered 1894-1901 in Crete by Sir Arthur Evans.

Originally, a preparation of solidified linseed oil used to coat canvas for making floor coverings; the word was applied to the flooring material itself after 1878. The Linoleum Manufacturing Company was formed 1864.
lint	lɪnt	late 14c., "flax prepared for spinning," also "refuse of flax used as kindling," somehow from the source of O.E. lin "flax" (see linen), perhaps from or by influence of M.Fr. linette "grain of flax," dim. of lin "flax," from L. linum "flax, linen;" Klein suggests from L. linteum "linen cloth," neut. of adjective linteus. Later "flax refuse used as tinder or for dressing wounds" (c.1400). Still used for "flax" in Scotland in Burns' time. Applied in Amer.Eng. to stray cotton fluff.

literal	ˈlitərəl	1530s, "in a literal sense," from literal + -ly (2). Erroneously used in reference to metaphors, hyperbole, etc., even by writers like Dryden and Pope, to indicate "what follows must be taken in the strongest admissible sense" (1680s), which is opposite to the word's real meaning.
literati	ˌlɪtəˈrɑ:ti:	"men and women of letters; the learned class as a whole," 1620s, from L. literati/litterati, plural of literatus/litteratus "lettered" (see literate). The proper singular would be literatus, though It. literato (1704) sometimes is used.

liturgical	lɪˈtɜ:dʒɪkəl	1640s, from L.L. liturgicus, from N.T. Gk. leitourgikos "ministering," from leitourgos (see liturgy).
liturgy	ˈlɪtədʒi:	1550s, "the service of the Holy Eucharist," from M.Fr. liturgie or directly from L.L./M.L. liturgia "public service, public worship," from Gk. leitourgia "a liturgy; public duty, ministration, ministry," from leitourgos "one who performs a public ceremony or service, public servant," from leito- "public" (from laos "people;" cf. leiton "public hall," leite "priestess;" see lay (adj.)) + -ergos "that works," from ergon "work" (see urge (v.)).

O.C.S., Rus. sliva "plum;" Lith. slywas "plum;" O.Ir. li, Welsh lliw "color, splendor," O.E. sla "sloe"). The sense of "furiously angry" (1912) is from the notion of being livid with rage.
loaf	ləuf	late 13c., from O.E. hlaf "portion of bread baked in a mass of definite form," from P.Gmc. *khlaibuz (cf. O.N. hleifr, Swed. lev, O.Fris. hlef, O.H.G. hleib, Ger. Laib, Goth. hlaifs "bread, loaf"), of uncertain origin, perhaps connected to O.E. hlifian "to raise higher, tower," on the notion of the bread rising as it bakes, but it is unclear whether "loaf" or "bread" is the original sense. Finnish leipä, O.C.S. chlebu, Lith. klepas probably are Germanic loan words. Meaning "chopped meat shaped like a bread loaf" is attested from 1787.
loam	ləʊm	O.E. lam "clay, mud, mire, earth," from P.Gmc. *laimaz (cf. O.S. lemo, Du. leem, Ger. Lehm "loam"), from PIE root *(s)lei- "slimy" (see slime (n.)). As a type of highly fertile clayey soil, it is attested from 1660s. As a verb from c.1600.
loan	ləun	mid-13c., from O.N. lan, related to lja "to lend," from P.Gmc. *laikhwniz (cf. O.Fris. len "thing lent," M.Du. lene, Du. leen "loan, fief," O.H.G. lehan, Ger. Lehn "fief, feudal tenure"), originally "to let have, to leave (to someone)," from PIE *leikw- "to leave" (see relinquish). The Norse word also is cognate with O.E. læn "gift," which did not survive into M.E., but its derived verb lænan is the source of lend. As a verb, loan is attested from 1540s, perhaps earlier, and was formerly current, but has now been supplanted in England by lend, though it survives in Amer.Eng. Loan word (1874) is a translation of Ger. Lehnwort; loan-translation is attested 1933, from Ger. Lehnübersetzung. Slang loan shark first attested 1900.
loath	ləʊθ	O.E. lað "hated; hateful; hostile; repulsive," from P.Gmc. *laithaz (cf. O.S., O.Fris. leth "loathsome," O.N. leiðr "hateful, hostile, loathed;" M.Du. lelijc, Du. leelijk "ugly;" O.H.G. leid "sorrowful, hateful, offensive, grievous," Ger. Leid "sorrow;" Fr. laid "ugly," from Frankish *laid), from PIE root *leit- "to detest." Weakened meaning "averse, disinclined" is attested from late 14c.

[A] strong lobbyist will permit himself to lose heavily at the poker-table, under the assumption that the great Congressman who wins the stake will look leniently upon the little appropriation he means to ask for. [George A. Townsend, "Events at the National Capital and the Campaign of 1876," Hartford, Conn., 1876] 
lobe	ləʊb	early 15c., "a lobe of the liver or lungs," from M.Fr. lobe and directly from M.L. lobus, from L.L. lobus "hull, husk, pod," from Gk. lobos "lobe of the ear, vegetable pod," perhaps related to Gk. leberis "husk of fruits," from PIE *logwos. Extended 1670s to divisions of the brain.
lobster	ˈlɔbstə	marine shellfish, O.E. loppestre "lobster, locust," corruption of L. locusta, lucusta "lobster, locust," by influence of O.E. loppe "spider," a variant of lobbe. The ending of O.E. loppestre is the fem. agent noun suffix (cf. Baxter, Webster; see -ster), which approximated the Latin sound. Perhaps a transferred use of the Latin word; trilobite fossils in Worcestershire limestone quarries were known colloquially as locusts, which seems to be the generic word for "unidentified arthropod," as apple is for "foreign fruit." OED says the Latin word originally meant "lobster or some similar crustacean, the application to the locust being suggested by the resemblance in shape." Locusta in the sense "lobster" also appears in French (langouste now "crawfish, crayfish," but in Old French "lobster" and "locust;" a 13c. psalter has God giving over the crops of Egypt to the langoustes) and Old Cornish (legast). As slang for "a British soldier" since 1640s, originally in reference to the jointed armor of the Roundhead cuirassiers, later (1660) to the red coat.Sir William Waller having received from London [in June 1643] a fresh regiment of five hundred horse, under the command of sir Arthur Haslerigge, which were so prodigiously armed that they were called by the other side the regiment of lobsters, because of their bright iron shells with which they were covered, being perfect curasseers. [Clarendon, "History of the Rebellion," 1647]
locale	ləʊˈkæl	1772, local, from Fr. local, noun use of local (adj.), from L. locus "place" (see locus). English spelling with -e (1816) probably is based on morale or else to indicate stress.The word's right to exist depends upon the question whether the two indispensable words locality & scene give all the shades of meaning required, or whether something intermediate is useful. [Fowler]
locate	ləuˈkeit	1650s, "to establish oneself in a place, settle," from L. locatus, pp. of locare "to place, put, set, dispose, arrange," from locus "a place" (see locus). Sense of "mark the limits of a place" (especially a land grant) is attested from 1739 in Amer.Eng.; this developed to "establish (something) in a place" (1807) and "to find out the place of" (1882, Amer.Eng.).

locus	ˈləʊkəs	(pl. loci), 1715, "locality," from L. locus "a place, spot, position," from O.Latin stlocus, lit. "where something is placed," from PIE root *st(h)el- "to cause to stand, to place." Used by Latin writers for Gk. topos. Mathematical sense by 1750.
locust	ˈləʊkəst	N.Amer. tree, 1630s, originally "carob tree" (1610s), whose fruit supposedly resembled the insect (see locust (1)). Greek akris "locust" often was applied in the Levant to carob pods. Soon applied in English to other trees as well.
locution	ləʊˈkju:ʃən	"style of speech," early 15c., from L. locutionem (nom. locutio) "a speaking, speech, discourse; way of speaking," noun of action from pp. stem of loqui "to speak," from PIE root *tolk(w)- (cf. O.Ir. ad-tluch- "to thank," to-tluch- "to ask;" O.C.S. tloko "interpretation, explanation"). Related: Locutionary.

lofty	ˈlɔfti	"exalted, of high rank," early 15c.; also "with a high purpose," from loft + -y (2). From early 14c. as a surname. Literal sense of "high" is attested from 1580s. Related: Loftily; loftiness.
log	lɔɡ	unshaped large piece of tree, early 14c., of unknown origin. O.N. had lag "felled tree" (from stem of liggja "to lie"), but on phonological grounds many etymologists deny that this is the root of English log. Instead, they suggest an independent formation meant to "express the notion of something massive by a word of appropriate sound." OED compares clog (n.) in its original Middle English sense "lump of wood." Log cabin (1770) in Amer.Eng. has been a figure of the honest pioneer since the 1840 presidential campaign of William Henry Harrison. Falling off a log as a type of something easy to do is from 1839.

Lotterbube "vagabond, rascal," lauschen "eavesdrop;" Goth. luton "mislead;" O.E. lyðre "base, bad, wicked." Related: Loitered; loitering.

long	lɔŋ	"that extends considerably from end to end," O.E. lang "long," from P.Gmc. *langgaz (cf. O.Fris., O.S. lang, O.H.G., Ger. lang, O.N. langr, M.Du. lanc, Du. lang, Goth. laggs "long"), perhaps from PIE *dlonghos- (cf. L. longus, O.Pers. darga-, Pers. dirang, Skt. dirghah, Gk. dolikhos "long," Gk. endelekhes "perpetual," L. indulgere "to indulge"), from root *del- "long." The adverb is from O.E. lange, longe, from the adjective; to be not long for this world "soon to die" is from 1714. The word illustrates the O.E. tendency for short "a" to become short "o" before -n- (also retained in bond/band and W. Midlands dialectal lond from land and hond from hand).

Loop the loop (1900) originally was in reference to roller-coasters at amusement parks.  "Loop-the-Loop" is the name of a new entertainment which goes further in the way of tempting Providence than anything yet invented. The "Loop" is an immense circle of track in the air. A car on a mimic railway shoots down a very steep incline, and is impelled around the inner side of this loop. ... The authorities at Coney Island are said to have prohibited "looping-the-loop" because women break their corset strings in their efforts to catch their breath as they sweep down the incline, and moreover, a young man is reported to have ruptured a blood vessel in his liver. ["Philadelphia Medical Journal," Aug. 10, 1901] 
loophole	ˈlu:pˌhəʊl	also loop-hole, mid-15c., from M.E. loupe "opening in a wall" for shooting through or admitting light (c.1300), perhaps related to M.Du. lupen "to watch, peer;" + hole (n.). Figurative sense of "outlet, means of escape" is from 1660s.

lynch	lɪntʃ	1835, from earlier Lynch law (1811), likely named after William Lynch (1742-1820) of Pittsylvania, Virginia, who c.1780 led a vigilance committee to keep order there during the Revolution. Other sources trace the name to Charles Lynch (1736-1796) a Virginia magistrate who fined and imprisoned Tories in his district c.1782, but the connection to him is less likely. Originally any sort of summary justice, especially by flogging; narrowing of focus to "extralegal execution by hanging" is 20c. Lynch mob is attested from 1838. The surname is perhaps from Ir.

The association with the dance of death seems to be via vivid descriptions of the martyrdom of the Maccabees in the Apocryphal books.

The typical form which the allegory takes is that of a series of pictures, sculptured or painted, in which Death appears, either as a dancing skeleton or as a shrunken corpse wrapped in grave-clothes to persons representing every age and condition of life, and leads them all in a dance to the grave.

(ta) metaphysika, from Gk. ta meta ta physika "the (works) after the Physics," title of the 13 treatises which traditionally were arranged after those on physics and natural sciences in Aristotle's writings. The name was given c.70 B.C.E. by Andronicus of Rhodes, and was a ref. to the customary ordering of the books, but it was misinterpreted by Latin writers as meaning "the science of what is beyond the physical." Hence, metaphysical came to be used in the sense of "abstract, speculative" (e.g. by Johnson, who applied it to certain 17c. poets, notably Donne and Cowley, who used "witty conceits" and abstruse imagery). The word originally was used in English in the singular; plural form predominated after 17c., but singular made a comeback late 19c. in certain usages under German influence.

In Gk., "parent state of a colony;" later, "see of a metropolitan bishop." In the West, the position now roughly corresponds to archbishop, but in the Greek church it ranks above it. In English, the adj. sense of "belonging to an ecclesiastical metropolis" is from 1540s; that of "belonging to a chief or capital city" is from 1550s. In reference to underground city railways, it is attested from 1867.

Related: Mingled; mingling.
mingy	ˈmɪndʒi:
miniature	ˈminiətʃə	1580s (n.) "a reduced image," from It. miniatura "manuscript illumination or small picture," from pp. of miniare "to illuminate a manuscript," from L. miniare "to paint red," from minium "red lead," used in ancient times to make red ink. Extended sense of "small" (adj.) is first attested 1714, because pictures in medieval manuscripts were small, influenced by L. min-, root expressing smallness (minor, minimus, minutus, etc.).

The useful M.E. verb mischieve (early 14c.) has, for some reason, fallen from currency.

O.Ir. molt "wether," Mid-Breton mout, Welsh mollt).

[Fowler]  Mutual Admiration Society (1851) seems to have been coined by Thoreau. Mutual fund is recorded from 1950. The Cold War's mutual assured destruction attested from 1966.

English retains a more exact sense of the word; its cognates in German, etc., have been generalized. Curiously absent in M.E., and perhaps reborrowed 16c. from M.L. or M.Fr., which got it from Germanic. Metaphoric extension to "anything which tests character or endurance" is attested from 1650s.

The shorter word was established in these distinct senses by 17c. Ordnance survey (1833), official survey of Great Britain and Ireland, was undertaken by the government under the direction of the Master-General of the Ordnance (a natural choice, because gunners have to be skilled at surveying ranges and distances).
ore	ɔ:	12c., merger of O.E. ora "ore, unworked metal" (related to ear "earth"); and O.E. ar "brass, copper, bronze," from P.Gmc. *ajiz- (cf.

In reference to plant growth, "vigorous, luxuriant," it is recorded from mid-13c. Sense evolved in M.E. to "large and coarse" (c.1300), then, via notion of "excessive and unpleasant," to "having a strong bad smell" (1520s). Much used 16c. as a pejorative intensive (cf. rank folly). This is possibly the source of the verb meaning "to reveal another's guilt" (1929, underworld slang), and that of "to harass, abuse," 1934, U.S. black dialect, though this also may be from the role of the activity in establishing social hierarchy (from rank (n.)).

Similar words are found in Celtic (Gael. radan), Romanic (It. ratto, Sp. rata, Fr. rat) and Germanic (M.L.G. rotte, Ger. ratte) languages, but connection is uncertain and origin unknown. Perhaps from V.L. *rattus, but Weekley thinks this is of Germanic origin, "the animal having come from the East with the race-migrations" and the word passing thence to the Romanic languages. American Heritage and Tucker connect O.E. ræt to L. rodere and thus PIE *red- "to scrape, scratch, gnaw," source of rodent (q.v.). Klein says there is no connection and suggests a possible cognate in Gk. rhine "file, rasp." Weekley connects them with a question mark and Barnhart writes, "the relationship to each other of the Germanic, Romance, and Celtic words for rat is uncertain." OED says "probable" the rat word spread from Germanic to Romanic, but takes no position on ultimate origin.  Middle English common form was ratton, from augmented O.Fr. form raton. Sense of "one who abandons his associates" (1620s) is from belief that rats leave a ship about to sink or a house about to fall and led to meaning "traitor, informant" (1902; verb 1910). Interjection rats is Amer.Eng., 1886. To smell a rat is c.1550. _____-rat, "person who frequents _____" (in earliest reference dock-rat) is from 1864. Rat-pack "juvenile gang" is from 1951.

The identical (in form) verb meaning "to wander, stray, rove" first appeared c.1300 in Scottish and northern dialect, and is probably from an unrelated Scandinavian word (cf. Icelandic rafa). Sense of "talk enthusiastically about" first recorded 1704. Noun meaning "rowdy party" is from 1960, though rave-up was British slang for "wild party" from 1940; specific modern sense of "mass party with loud, fast electronic music and often psychedelic drugs" is from 1989. Raver, from this sense, is first recorded 1991.

"to scratch, slash, scrape, erase," from O.Fr. raser "to scrape, shave," from M.L. rasare, frequentative of L. radere (pp. rasus) "to scrape, shave," perhaps from PIE *razd- (cf. L. rastrum "rake"), possible extended form of root *red- "to scrape, scratch, gnaw" (see rodent). Related: Razed; razing.
razor	ˈreizə	late 13c., from O.Fr. rasour "a razor" (12c.), from raser "to scrape, shave" (see raze). The use of razorback for a type of pig with a sharp ridge-like back dates from 1849.
razzle	ˈræzl	1886, Amer.Eng. slang, varied reduplication of dazzle (q.v.).  My confrère, The Chevalier, last month gave a new name to the scarfs of disjointed pattern when he called them the razzle-dazzle. The name was evidently a hit of the most patent character, for in several avenue and Broadway stores the clerks have thrown out a display of broken figures before me and explained that the ruling style at present was the razzle-dazzle, and the word seems to have been equally effective with the public, for when it is quoted by the live salesman, the customer, I am told is at once interested and caught by it.

Early variant rym (late 15c.) suggests a Dutch influence (cf. Du. riem), probably during the time of Spanish Hapsburg control of Holland. Properly, 20 quires or 480 sheets, usually 500 or more to allow for waste. Of paper for printing, 21 and a half quires, or 516 sheets (printers' ream).

Rebel yell in an American Civil War context attested from 1862, but the thing itself is older and was said to have been picked up by southwestern men in their periodic wars against the Indians. The Southern troops, when charging or to express their delight, always yell in a manner peculiar to themselves. ...

O.C.S. ravinu "level," O.Ir. roi, roe "plain field," O.E. rum "space;" see room).In early examples, there is usually little or no difference between the meanings of rural and rustic, but in later use the tendency is to employ rural when the idea of locality (country scenes, etc.) is prominent, and rustic when there is a suggestion of the more primitive qualities or manners naturally attaching to country life. [OED]

sable	ˈseɪbəl	mid-14c., "black" as a heraldic color, commonly identified with sable (1), but the animal's fur is brown and this may be a different word of unknown origin; it may reflect a medieval custom (unattested) of dyeing sable fur black. As an adjective from late 14c.
sabotage	ˈsæbəˌtɑ:ʒ	1910, from Fr. sabotage, from saboter "to sabotage, bungle," lit. "walk noisily," from sabot "wooden shoe" (13c.), altered (by association with O.Fr. bot "boot") from M.Fr. savate "old shoe," from an unidentified source that also produced similar words in Old Provençal, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Arabic and Basque. In French, the sense of "deliberately and maliciously destroying property" originally was in reference to labor disputes, but the oft-repeated story that the modern meaning derives from strikers' supposed tactic of throwing old shoes into machinery is not supported by the etymology.

sacred	ˈseikrid	c.1300, from pp. of obsolete verb sacren "to make holy" (early 13c.), from O.Fr. sacrer (12c.), from L. sacrare "to make sacred, consecrate," from sacer (gen. sacri) "sacred, dedicated, holy, accursed," from O.L. saceres, which Tucker connects to base *saq- "bind, restrict, enclose, protect," explaining that "words for both 'oath' & 'curse' are regularly words of 'binding.' " But Buck merely groups it with Oscan sakrim, Umbrian sacra and calls it "a distinctive Italic group, without any clear outside connections." Nasalized form is sancire "make sacred, confirm, ratify, ordain." Sacred cow "object of Hindu veneration," is from 1891; figurative sense of "one who must not be criticized" is first recorded 1910, reflecting Western views of Hinduism.

L. salix "willow," M.Ir. sail, Welsh helygen, Breton halegen "willow"). Fr. saule "willow" is from Frank. salha, from the Germanic root. Used in Palm Sunday processions and decorations in England before the importing of real palm leaves began.
salmon	ˈsæmən	c.1200, from O.Fr. salmun, from L. salmonem (nom. salmo) "a salmon," possibly originally "leaper," from salire "to leap," though some dismiss this as folk etymology. Another theory traces it to Celtic. Replaced O.E. læx, from PIE *lax, the more usual word for the fish (see lox).

Under English law, one claiming the right of sanctuary had 40 days to confess and accept permanent banishment. This was abolished in Britain 1625 in criminal cases, 1696, 1722 in civil cases.
sanctum	ˈsæŋktəm	1570s, from L. sanctum "a holy place," as in L.L. sanctum sanctorum "holy of holies" (from Gk. to hagion ton hagion, from Heb. qodesh haqqodashim), from neut. of sanctus "holy" (see saint). In English, sanctum sanctorum attested from c.1400; sense of "a person's private retreat" is from 1706.
sane	sein	1721, back-formation from sanity. Used earlier, of the body, with the sense of "healthy" (1620s).
sangfroid	sɑ:ŋˈfrwɑ:
sanguinary	ˈsæŋgwəˌneri:	"characterized by slaughter," 1620s, possibly from Fr. sanguinaire, or directly from L. sanguinarius "pertaining to blood," from sanguis (gen. sanguinis) "blood," of unknown origin. L. distinguished sanguis, the generic word, from cruor "blood from a wound." The latter word is related to Gk. kreas "meat," Skt. kravis- "raw flesh," O.E. hreaw- "raw" (see raw).
sanguine	ˈsæŋgwɪn	early 14c., "type of red cloth," from O.Fr. sanguin (fem. sanguine), from L. sanguineus "of blood," also "bloody, bloodthirsty," from sanguis (gen. sanguinis) "blood" (see sanguinary). Meaning "blood-red" is recorded from late 14c. Meaning "cheerful, hopeful, confident" first attested c.1500, since these qualities were thought in medieval physiology to spring from an excess of blood as one of the four humors.
sanitary	ˈsænɪˌteri:	1842, from Fr. sanitaire (1812), from L. sanitas "health," from sanus "healthy, sane." In ref. to menstrual pads, first attested 1881 (in sanitary towel).

sap	sæp	"liquid in a plant," O.E. sæp, from P.Gmc. *sapom (cf. M.L.G., M.Du., Du. sap, O.H.G. saf, Ger. Saft "juice"), from PIE *sapon- (cf. L. sapere "to taste"), from root *sab- "juice, fluid" (cf. Skt. sabar- "sap, milk, nectar").
sapience	ˈseɪpɪəns	c.1300, wisdom, understanding, from O.Fr. sapience, from L. sapientia, from sapientem (see sapient).
sapient	ˈseɪpi:ənt	"wise," late 15c., from O.Fr. sapient, from L. sapientem (nom. sapiens), prp. of sapere "to taste, have taste, be wise," from PIE root *sep- "to taste, perceive" (cf. O.S. an-sebban "to perceive, remark," O.H.G. antseffen, O.E. sefa "mind, understanding, insight;" see sap (n.1)).
sapless	ˈsæplɪs
sapling	ˈsæplɪŋ	early 15c., from sap (n.1) + dim. suffix -ling. This is probably the source of Amer.Eng. slang sap "club, short staff" (1899) and the verb sap "to hit (someone) with a sap" (1926).
sapphire	ˈsæfˌaɪə	late 13c., from O.Fr. saphir (12c.), from L. sapphirus (cf. Sp. zafir, It. zaffiro), from Gk. sappheiros "blue stone" (the gem meant apparently was not the one that now has the name, but perhaps rather "lapis lazuli," the modern sapphire perhaps signified by Gk. hyakinthos), from a Semitic source (cf. Heb. sappir "sapphire"), but probably not ult. from Semitic; some linguists propose an origin in Skt. sanipriya, a dark precious stone (perhaps sapphire or emerald), lit. "sacred to Saturn," from Sani "Saturn" + priyah "precious." In Renaissance lapidaries, it was said to cure anger and stupidity.
sarcasm	ˈsɑ:ˌkæzəm	1570s, from L.L. sarcasmos, from Gk. sarkasmos "a sneer, jest, taunt, mockery," from sarkazein "to speak bitterly, sneer," lit. "to strip off the flesh," from sarx (gen. sarkos) "flesh," prop. "piece of meat," from PIE root *twerk- "to cut" (cf. Avestan thwares "to cut"). Sarcastic is from 1690s. For nuances of usage, see humor.
sarcastic	sɑ:ˈkæstik	1690s, from sarcasm. Related: Sarcastically.
sardonic	sɑ:ˈdɔnɪk	1630s, from Fr. sardonique (16c.), from L. sardonius (but as if from L. *sardonicus) in Sardonius risus, loan-translation of Gk. sardonios (gelos) "of bitter or scornful (laughter)," altered from Homeric sardanios (of uncertain origin) by influence of Sardonios "Sardinian," because the Greeks believed that eating a certain plant they called sardonion (lit. "plant from Sardinia," see Sardinia) caused facial convulsions resembling those of sardonic laughter, usually followed by death. For nuances of usage, see humor. Related: Sardonically.
sartorial	sɑ:ˈtɔ:ri:əl	"pertaining to a tailor," 1823, from Mod.L. sartorius, from L.L. sartor "tailor," lit. "patcher, mender," from L. sart-, pp. stem of sarcire "to patch, mend." Sartorius as the name of the long leg muscle is because it is used in crossing the legs to bring them into the position needed to sit like a tailor. Related: Sartorially.
sash	sæʃ	"strip of cloth," 1590s, "strip of cloth twisted into a turban," from Arabic shash "muslin cloth." Meaning "strip of cloth worn about the waist or over the shoulder" first recorded 1680s.

satiate	ˈseɪʃi:ˌeɪt	mid-15c., from L. satiatus, pp. of satiare "fill full, satisfy," from satis "enough," from PIE root *sa- "to satisfy" (cf. Goth. saþs "satiated," O.E. sæd "satisfied;" see sad). Related: Satiated; satiating; satiation.
satiety	səˈtaɪɪti:	1530s, from Fr. satiété (12c.), from L. satietatem "abundance," from satis "enough," from PIE root *sa- "to satisfy" (see sad).
satiny	ˈsætni:
satire	'sætaiə	late 14c., "work intended to ridicule vice or folly," from L. satira "satire, poetic medley," earlier satura, in lanx satura "mixed dish, dish filled with various kinds of fruit," lit. "full dish," from fem. of satur "sated" (see saturate). First applied in literary sense to a collection of poems on a variety of subjects by Ennius. In classical Latin, a poem which assailed the prevailing vices, one after another. Altered in Latin by influence of Gk. satyr, on mistaken notion that the form is related to the Greek satyr drama (see satyr).Satire, n. An obsolete kind of literary composition in which the vices and follies of the author's enemies were expounded with imperfect tenderness. In this country satire never had more than a sickly and uncertain existence, for the soul of it is wit, wherein we are dolefully deficient, the humor that we mistake for it, like all humor, being tolerant and sympathetic. Moreover, although Americans are 'endowed by their Creator' with abundant vice and folly, it is not generally known that these are reprehensible qualities, wherefore the satirist is popularly regarded as a sour-spirited knave, and his every victim's outcry for codefendants evokes a national assent. [Ambrose Bierce, "Devil's Dictionary," 1911]    Proper satire is distinguished, by the generality of the reflections, from a lampoon which is aimed against a particular person, but they are too frequently confounded. [Johnson]    [I]n whatever department of human expression, wherever there is objective truth there is satire [Wyndham Lewis, "Rude Assignment," 1950]  For nuances of usage, see humor.
satirical	səˈtɪrɪkəl	1520s, from L.L. satiricus, from L. satira "satire, poetic medley" (see satire).

saturnalia	ˌsætəˈneɪli:ə	"time of merrymaking," 1590s, from L. Saturnalia, ancient Roman festival of Saturn (held in December), a time of merrymaking for all, from neut. pl. of adj. Saturnalis "pertaining to Saturn," from Saturnus (see Saturn). The extended sense of "period of unrestrained revelry" is first attested 1782.
saturnine	ˈsætəˌnaɪn	"gloomy, morose, sluggish, grave," mid-15c., lit. "born under the influence of the planet Saturn," from M.E. Saturne (see Saturn). Medieval physiology believed these characteristics to be caused by the astrological influence of the planet Saturn, which was the most remote from the Sun (in the limited knowledge of the times) and thus coldest and slowest in its revolution.
saunter	ˈsɔ:ntə	late 15c., santren "to muse, be in reverie," of uncertain origin. Meaning "walk with a leisurely gait" is from 1660s, and may be a different word entirely. Some suggest this word derives via Anglo-Fr. sauntrer (mid-14c.) from Fr. s'aventurer "to take risks," but OED finds this "unlikely." The noun meaning "a leisurely stroll" is recorded from 1828. Related: Sauntered; sauntering. 
savage	ˈsævidʒ	c.1300, "wild, undomesticated, untamed" (of animals and places), from O.Fr. sauvage, salvage "wild, savage, untamed," from L.L. salvaticus, alteration of silvaticus "wild," lit. "of the woods," from silva "forest, grove." Of persons, the meaning "reckless, ungovernable" is attested from c.1400, earlier in sense "indomitable, valiant" (c.1300).

savanna	səˈvænə	also savanna, "treeless plain," 1550s, from Sp. sabana, earlier zavana "treeless plain," from Taino (Arawakan) zabana. In U.S. use, "a tract of low-lying marshy ground" (1670s).
savant	sæˈvɑ:nt	1719, from Fr. savant "a learned man," noun use of adj. savant "learned, knowing," former prp. of savoir "to know," from O.Fr., from V.L. *sapere, from L. sapere "be wise" (see sapient).
savor	ˈseivə	"pleasing in taste or smell," early 13c., from O.Fr. savoure (Fr. savoré),  pp. of savourer "to taste" (see savor).
savory	ˈseɪvəri:	"aromatic mint," late 14c., perhaps an alteration of O.E. sæþerie, which is ultimately from L. satureia "savory (n.)." But early history of the word suggests transmission via O.Fr. savereie. In either case, the form of the word probably altered by influence of the M.E. or O.Fr. form of savory (adj.).
sawdust	ˈsɔ:ˌdʌst	1520s, from saw (1) + dust (n.).
scab	skæb	mid-13c., "skin disease," developed from O.E. sceabb "scab, itch" (related to scafan "to scratch") and from O.N. skabb "scab, itch," both from P.Gmc. *skab- "scratch, shave" (related to shabby). Sense reinforced by cognate L. scabies "scab, itch, mange" (from scabere "to scratch;" see scabies). Meaning "crust which forms over a wound or sore" is first attested c.1400. Meaning "strikebreaker" first recorded 1806, from earlier sense of "person who refuses to join a trade union" (1777), probably from meaning "despicable person" (1580s), possibly borrowed in this sense from M.Du.
scabbard	ˈskæbəd	c.1300, from Anglo-Fr. *escauberc "sheath, vagina" (13c.), probably from Frank. *skar "blade" (cf. O.H.G. scar "scissors, blade, sword") + *berg- "protect" (cf. O.H.G. bergan "to protect").
scabrous	ˈskæbrəs	1570s (implied in scabrously), from L.L. scabrosus "rough," from L. scaber "rough, scaly," related to scabere "to scratch, scrape" (see scabies). Sense in English evolved from "harsh, unmusical," to "vulgar" (1881), "squalid" (1939) and "nasty, repulsive" (c.1951).
scads	skædz	"large amounts," 1869, Amer.Eng., earlier "dollar" (1858, usually in plural), of uncertain origin. Unknown connection to scad, the fish.
scaffold	ˈskæfəld	mid-14c. (implied in scaffolding), aphetic of an O.N.Fr. variant of O.Fr. eschafaut "scaffold," probably altered (by influence of eschace "a prop, support") from chaffaut, from V.L. *catafalicum (see catafalque).

scalding	ˈskɔ:ldɪŋ
scale	skeil	"pan of a balance," late 14c., earlier "drinking cup" (c.1200), from O.N. skal "bowl, drinking cup," in pl., "weighing scale" from P.Gmc. *skælo "split, divide" (cf. O.N. skel "shell," O.E. scalu, O.S. skala, O.H.G. scala, Ger. Schale, M.Du. scale, Du. schaal "drinking cup, bowl, shell, scale of a balance"), see scale (n.1). The connecting sense seems to be of half of a bivalve ("split") shell used as a drinking cup or a pan for weighing. But according to Paulus Diaconus the "drinking cup" sense originated from a supposed custom of making goblets from skulls (see skull).
scalp	skælp	c.1300, presumably from a Scandinavian source (though exact cognates are wanting) related to O.N. skalli "bald head," skalpr "sheath," from the source of scale (n.2). Fr. scalpe, Ger., Swed. skalp are from English. The verb meaning "to cut off (someone's) scalp" is recorded from 1670s, originally in reference to N.Amer. Indians. Related: Scalped; scalping.
scalpel	ˈskælpəl	1742, from L. scalpellum, dim. of scalprum "knife, chisel, tool for scraping or cutting," from scalpere "to carve, cut," related to sculpere "to carve," from PIE root *(s)kel- "to cut, cleave."

scanty	ˈskænti:	1650s, from scant + -y (2).
scar	skɑ:	1540s, "cover witch scratches," from Fr. scarifier (14c.), from L.L. scarificare (see scarification). The sense "cover with scars" (1680s) is a sense-shift from influence of scar.
scared	skeəd	p.t. and pp. of scare. Scared stiff first recorded 1900; scared shitless is from 1936. Scaredy-cat "timid person" first attested 1933, in Dorothy Parker.
scarf	skɑ:f	"eat hastily," 1960, U.S. teen slang, originally a noun meaning "food, meal" (1932), perhaps imitative, or from scoff (attested in a similar sense from 1846). Or perhaps from a dial. survival of O.E. sceorfan "to gnaw, bite" (see scarf (2)); a similar word is found in a S.African context in the 1600s.
scarp	skɑ:p	"steep slope," 1580s, from It. scarpa "slope," probably from a Germanic source, perhaps Goth. *skrapa (cf. M.H.G. schroffe "sharp rock, crag," O.E. scræf "cave, grave").
scathe	skeɪð	c.1200, from O.N. skaða "to hurt, injure," from P.Gmc. *skath- (cf. O.E. sceaþian "to hurt, injure," O.Fris. skethia, M.Du. scaden, Du. schaden, O.H.G. scadon, Ger. schaden, Goth. scaþjan "to injure, damage"), from PIE root *sket- "to injure." Only cognate outside Germanic seems to be in Gk. a-skethes "unharmed, unscathed." Survives mostly in its negative form, unscathed, and in figurative meaning "sear with invective or satire" (1852, usually as scathing) which developed from the sense of "scar, scorch" used by Milton in "Paradise Lost" i.613 (1667). Related: Scathingly.
scathing	ˈskeɪðɪŋ	c.1200, from O.N. skaða "to hurt, injure," from P.Gmc. *skath- (cf. O.E. sceaþian "to hurt, injure," O.Fris. skethia, M.Du. scaden, Du. schaden, O.H.G. scadon, Ger. schaden, Goth. scaþjan "to injure, damage"), from PIE root *sket- "to injure." Only cognate outside Germanic seems to be in Gk. a-skethes "unharmed, unscathed."

Related: Scathingly.
scatter	ˈskætə	mid-12c., possibly a northern English variant of M.E. schateren (see shatter), reflecting Norse influence. Scattershot (adj.) is attested from 1961; figurative use of term for a kind of gun charge meant to broadcast the pellets when fired.

Slang shortening schizo first attested 1920s as an adj., 1945 as a noun.
schooner	ˈsku:nə	1716, perhaps from a New England verb related to Scottish scon "to send over water, to skip stones." Skeat relates this dial. verb to shunt. Spelling probably influenced by Du., but Du. schoener is a loan-word from English, as are Ger. Schoner, Fr. schooner, Swed. skonert. Said to have originated in Gloucester, Mass., shipyard.The rig characteristic of a schooner has been defined as consisting essentially of two gaff sails, the after sail not being smaller than the fore, and a head sail set on a bowsprit.

O.N. skaup, skop "mockery," M.Dan. skof "jest, mockery;" perhaps from P.Gmc. *skub-, *skuf- (cf.

scorching	ˈskɔtʃɪŋ	brightest star, late 14c., from Gk. Seirios, lit. "scorching." Probably so called from its ancient heliacal rising at the summer solstice (see dog days). An Egyptian name for it was Sothis.

simile	ˈsɪməli:	late 14c., from L. simile "a like thing," neuter of similis "like" (see similar). "A simile, to be perfect, must both illustrate and ennoble the subject." [Johnson].
simper	ˈsɪmpə	1560s, perhaps from a Scandinavian source (e.g. dial. Dan. semper "affected, coy, prudish") or M.Du. zimperlijk "affected, coy, prim."
simulate	ˈsimjuleit	1620s (implied in simulated), from L. simulatus, pp. of simulare (see simulation). First record of simulated in sense of "imitative for purposes of experiment or training" is from 1966 (simulation in this sense dates from 1954).

singularity	ˌsɪŋgjəˈlærɪti:	mid-14c., singleness of aim or purpose, from O.Fr. singularité (12c.) or directly from L.L. singularitas, from singularis (see singular).

The Latin word was used in augury in the sense of "unlucky, unfavorable" (omens, especially bird flights, seen on the left hand were regarded as portending misfortune), and thus sinister acquired a sense of "harmful, unfavorable, adverse." This was from Greek influence, reflecting the early Greek practice of facing north when observing omens; in genuine Roman auspices, the left was favorable. Bend (not "bar") sinister in heraldry indicates illegitimacy and preserves the lit. sense of "on the left side."
sinuous	ˈsɪnju:əs	"full of turns and curves," 1570s, from L. sinuosus "full of folds or bendings," from sinus "curve, fold, bend."

Gk. skleros "hard"). The Greek word was borrowed in L.L. (sceletus), hence Fr. squelette, Sp. esqueleto, It. scheletro. The meaning "bare outline" is first recorded c.1600; hence skeleton crew (1778), skeleton key, etc. Phrase skeleton in the closet "source of secret shame to a person or family" popularized 1845 by Thackeray, though he likely didn't coin it.
skeptic	ˈskeptɪk	also sceptic, 1580s, "member of an ancient Greek school that doubted the possibility of real knowledge," from Fr. sceptique, from L. scepticus, from Gk. skeptikos (pl. Skeptikoi "the Skeptics"), lit.

Greek revival and is preferred in U.S.Skeptic does not mean him who doubts, but him who investigates or researches as opposed to him who asserts and thinks that he has found. [Miguel de Unamuno, "Essays and Soliloquies," 1924]

First element apparently unconnected with skew (v.); OED suggests perhaps from O.Fr. escu "shield," but also notes a close resemblance in form and sense with Icel. skjottr, "the history of which is equally obscure." When the white is mixed with black it is called 'pie-bald,' with bay the name of 'skew-bald' is given to it. ["Youatt's 'The Horse,' " 1866]

Skimmer, the N.Amer. shore bird (1785), so called from its method of feeding.

skulk	skʌlk	early 13c., from a Scandinavian source, cf. Norw. skulke "to shirk, malinger," Dan. skulke "to spare oneself, shirk." Common in M.E. but lacking in 15c.-16c. records; possibly reborrowed 17c.
skull	skʌl	early 13c., probably from O.N. skalli "bald head, skull," a general Scandinavian word (cf. Swedish skulle, Norw. skult), probably related to O.E. scealu "husk" (see shell). But early prominence in southwestern texts suggests rather origin from a Dutch or Low Ger. cognate (e.g. Du. schol "turf, piece of ice," but the sense of "head bone framework" is wanting).

stir	stə:	1908, from stir "prison" (1851), probably from Start Newgate (1757), prison in London, later any prison (1823), probably from Romany stardo "imprisoned," related to staripen "a prison." Mid-19c. sturaban, sturbin "state prison" seem to be transitional forms.

stock	stɔk	"supply for future use" (early 15c.), "sum of money" (mid-15c.), M.E. developments of stock (n.1), but the ultimate sense connection is uncertain. Perhaps the notion is of the "trunk" from which gains are an outgrowth, or obs. sense of "money-box" (c.1400). Meaning "subscribed capital of a corporation" is from 1610s. Stock exchange is attested from 1773. The verb meaning "to supply (a store) with stock" is from 1620s; in stock "in the possession of a trader" is from 1610s.

["Cassell's History of the Boer War," 1901] 
stolid	ˈstɔlɪd	1560s (implied in stolidity), from M.Fr. stolide (16c.), from L. stolidus "insensible, dull, brutish," properly "unmovable," related to stultus "foolish," from PIE root *stel- "to put, stand" (see stall (n.1)).
stomach	ˈstʌmək	c.1300, "internal pouch into which food is digested," from O.Fr. estomac, from L. stomachus "stomach, throat," also "pride, inclination, indignation" (which were thought to have their origin in that organ), from Gk. stomachos "throat, gullet, esophagus," lit. "mouth, opening," from stoma "mouth" (see stoma). Applied to the openings of various internal organs, especially the stomach, then to the stomach itself. Some 16c. anatomists tried to correct the sense back to "esophagus" and introduce ventricle for what we call the stomach. Meaning "belly, midriff, part of the body that contains the stomach" is from late 14c. Figurative senses in L. extended into M.E. (cf. "relish, inclination, desire," 1510s). The verb meaning "to tolerate, put up with" is from 1570s; earlier sense was opposite: "to be offended at, resent" (1520s), from L. stomachari "to be resentful." Stomach ache is from 1763.
stonewall	ˈstəʊnˌwɔ:l	O.E. stanwalle (n.); see stone (n.) + wall. As nickname of Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson (1824-1863), bestowed 1861 on the occasion of the First Battle of Bull Run, supposedly by Gen. Bernard Bee, urging his brigade to rally around Jackson, who was standing like a stone wall. Bee was killed in the battle; the account of the nickname appeared in Southern newspapers within four days of the battle.  On the face of it this account has no character of authenticity, and the words ascribed to Bee smack less of the battlefield than of the editorial sanctum. ... It seems inherently probable that something was said by somebody, during or immediately after the battle, that likened Jackson or his men or both to a stone wall. [R.M. Johnston, Bull Run: Its Strategy and Tactics, Boston, 1913]   As a verb, "to obstruct," 1914, from metaphoric use of stone wall for "act of obstruction" (1876). Related: Stonewalled; stonewalling.

Streit "fight, contention, combat," O.N. striðr "strong, hard, stubborn, severe"), from root *strid- "to strive, make a strong effort." Meaning "to walk with long or extended steps" is from c.1200. Cognate words in most Gmc. languages mean "to fight, struggle;" the notion behind the English usage might be the effort involved in making long strides, striving forward.

The meaning "wealthy, elegant person" is first recorded 1786; hence the adj. meaning "fashionably dressed or equipped" (1810), both from the notion of "puffed-up, pompous" behavior. The sense of "good, excellent" first occurs 1897, and as a stand-alone expression of satisfaction it is recorded from 1930 in Amer.Eng.
swelter	ˈsweltə	c.1400, frequentative of swelten "be faint (especially with heat)," late 14c., from O.E. sweltan "to die," from P.Gmc. *swel- (cf. O.S. sweltan "to die," O.N. svelta "to put to death, starve," Goth. sviltan "to die"), originally "to burn slowly," hence "to be overcome with heat or fever;" also the source of O.E. swelan "to burn," from PIE root *swel- "to shine, burn" (see Selene). For specialization of words meaning "to die," cf. starve.
sweltering	ˈsweltərɪŋ
swerve	swə:v	early 13c., "to depart, make off;" early 14c., "to turn aside, deviate from a straight course," probably from O.E. sweorfan "to rub, scour, file" (but sense development is difficult to trace), from P.Gmc. *swerbanan (cf O.N. sverfa "to scour, file," O.S. swebran "to wipe off"), from PIE root *swerbh-. Cognate words in other Germanic languages (cf. O.Fris. swerva "to creep," M.Du. swerven "to rove, stray") suggests the sense of "go off, turn aside" may have existed in O.E., though unrecorded. The noun is recorded from 1741.

Schwein), neuter adjective (with suffix *-ino-) from PIE *su- (see sow (n.)). The native word, largely ousted by pig. Applied to persons from late 14c. Phrase pearls before swine is from Matt. vii:6; an early English formation of it was: Ne ge ne wurpen eowre meregrotu toforan eo wrum swynon. [c.1000]  The Latin word was confused in French with marguerite "daisy" (the "pearl" of the field), and in Dutch the expression became "roses before swine."

O.S., O.H.G. swingan, O.Fris. swinga, Ger. schwingen "to swing, swingle, oscillate") denoting "violent circulatory motion." The meaning "move freely back and forth" is first recorded 1540s.

swoop	swu:p	1560s, "to move or walk in a stately manner," apparently from a dialectal survival of O.E. swapan "to sweep, brandish, dash," from P.Gmc. *swaipanan, from PIE root *swei- "to swing, bend, to turn." Meaning "pounce upon with a sweeping movement" first recorded 1630s. Spelling with -oo- may have been influenced by Scottish and northern England dialectal soop "to sweep," from O.N. sopa "to sweep."

The sense of "meeting on some subject" is from 1784. Reflecting the Greek fondness for mixing wine and intellectual discussion, the modern sense is especially from the word being used as a title for one of Plato's dialogues. Greek plural is symposia, and the leader of one is a symposiarch (c.1600 in English).
symptom	ˈsimptəm	1540s, earlier sinthoma (late 14c.), from M.L. sinthoma "symptom of a disease," from L.L. symptoma, from Gk. symptoma (gen. symptomatos) "a happening, accident, disease," from stem of sympiptein "to befall," from syn- "together" + piptein "to fall," from PIE root *pet- "to rush, to fly" (see petition).

therapeutic	ˌθerəˈpju:tɪk	pertaining to the healing of disease, 1640s, probably shortened from therapeutical (c.1600), from Mod.L. therapeuticus "curing, healing," from Gk. therapeutikos, from therapeutes "one ministering," from therapeutein "to cure, treat," of unknown origin, related to therapon (gen. therapontos) "attendant." Therapeutic was used from 1540s as a noun meaning "the branch of medicine concerned with treatment of disease."

Meaning "to make wild movements like those of a flail or whip" is attested from 1846. Related: Thrashed; thrashing. Type of fast heavy metal music first called by this name 1982.
threadbare	ˈθredˌbeə	mid-14c., from thread + bare. The notion is of "having the nap worn off," leaving bare the threads.
threnody	ˈθrenədi:	"song of lamentation," 1630s, from Gk. threnodia, from threnos "dirge, lament," + oide "ode." Gk. threnos probably is from a PIE imitative root meaning "to murmur, hum;" cf. O.E. dran "drone," Goth. drunjus "sound," Gk. tenthrene "a kind of wasp."
threshold	ˈθreʃhəuld	O.E. þrescold, þærscwold, þerxold "doorsill, point of entering," first element related to O.E. þrescan (see thresh), with its original sense of "tread, trample." Second element of unknown origin and much transformed in all the Germanic languages; in English it probably has been altered to conform to hold, but the oft-repeated story that the threshold was a barrier placed at the doorway to hold the chaff flooring in the room is mere folk etymology. Cognates include O.N. þreskjoldr, Swed. tröskel, O.H.G. driscufli, Ger. dial. drischaufel.
thrift	θrift	c.1300, "fact or condition of thriving," also "prosperity, savings," from M.E. thriven "to thrive" (see thrive), possibly influenced by O.N. þrift, variant of þrif "prosperity," from þrifask "to thrive."

throaty	ˈθrəʊti:
throb	θrɔb	mid-14c., of uncertain origin, perhaps meant to represent in sound the pulsation of arteries and veins or the heart. The noun is first attested 1570s.
throng	θrɔŋ	c.1300, probably shortened from O.E. geþrang "crowd, tumult" (related to verb þringan "to push, crowd, press"), from P.Gmc. *thrangan (cf. O.N. þröng, Du. drang, Ger. Drang "crowd, throng"). The verb, in the sense of "go in a crowd," is first recorded 1530s. Related: Thronged; thronging.
throttle	ˈθrɔtl	"strangle to death," c.1400, probably from M.E. throte "throat" (see throat). The noun, in the mechanical sense, is first recorded 1870s, from throttle-valve (1824), but was used earlier as a synonym for "throat" (1540s); it appears to be an independent formation, not derived from the verb.
thrust	θrʌst	late 12c., from O.N. þrysta "to thrust, force," from P.Gmc. *thrustijanan, perhaps from PIE *trud- "push, press" (see threat), but OED finds this derivation doubtful. The noun is recorded from 1510s; figurative sense of "principal theme, aim, point, purpose" is recorded from 1968.
thump	θʌmp	1530s, "to strike hard," probably imitative of the sound made by hitting with a heavy object (cf. E.Fris. dump "a knock," Swed. dial. dumpa "to make a noise"). The noun is first recorded 1550s. Thumping (adj.) "exceptionally large" is colloquial from 1570s.

M.Du. dwers, Du. dwars "cross-grained, contrary," O.H.G. twerh, Ger. quer, Goth. þwairhs "angry"), altered (by influence of *thwer- "to turn") from *therkh-, from PIE *twork-/*twerk- "twist" (cf. L. torquere "to twist," Skt. tarkuh "spindle," O.C.S. traku "band, girdle," O.H.G. drahsil "turner," Ger. drechseln "to turn on a lathe"). The verb meaning "oppose, hinder" is mid-13c., from the adv. and prep.
tickler	ˈtɪklə	1610s, coined in Modern Latin, from Late Gk. kleitoris, a diminutive, but the exact sense is uncertain. Perhaps from Gk. kleiein "to sheathe," also "to shut," in reference to its being covered by the labia minora. The related Greek noun form kleis has a second meaning of "a key, a latch or hook (to close a door);" see close (v.), and cf. slot (2). Some ancient medical sources give a supposed Greek verb kleitoriazein "to touch or titillate lasciviously, to tickle" (cf. Ger. slang der Kitzler "clitoris," lit. "the tickler"), but the verb is likely from the anatomy in this case. Perhaps related to Gk. kleitys, a variant of klitys "side of a hill," itself related to klinein "to slope," from the same root as climax (see lean (v.)), and with a sense of "little hill." The anatomist Mateo Renaldo Colombo (1516-1559), professor at Padua, claimed to have discovered it ("De re anatomica," 1559, p. 243). He called it amor Veneris, vel dulcedo "the love or sweetness of Venus." It had been known earlier to women.
tiddler	ˈtɪdlə
tidings	ˈtaɪdɪŋz	"announcement of an event," 1069, from O.E. tidung "event, occurrence, piece of news," perhaps in part a verbal noun from O.E. tidan "to happen," in part from O.N. tiðendi (pl.) "events, news," from tiðr (adj.) "occurring," from PIE *di-ti- (see tide). Cf. Norw. tidende "tidings, news," Du. tijding, Ger. Zeitung "newspaper").
tidy	ˈtaidi	mid-13c., probably originally "in season, timely, opportune, excellent," from tide in the sense of "season, time" (see tide). Cf. O.H.G. zitig, Ger. zeitig, Du. tijdig, Dan. tidig "timely." Meaning "neat and in order" first recorded 1706. The verb in this sense is from 1821.
tier	tɪə	"row, rank, range," 1560s, from M.Fr. tire, from O.Fr. tire "rank, sequence, order" (early 13c.), probably from tirer "to draw, draw out" (see tirade). Some suggests the O.Fr. noun is from a Germanic source akin to O.H.G. ziari, Ger. Zier "adornment," O.E. tir "glory, honor."

tile	tail	O.E. tigele "roofing shingle," from W.Gmc. *tegala (cf. O.H.G. ziagal, Ger. ziegel, Du. tegel, O.N. tigl), a borrowing from L. tegula "tile" (cf. It. tegola, Fr. tuile), from tegere "roof, to cover" (see stegosaurus). Also used in O.E. and early M.E. for "brick," before that word came into use. The verb meaning "to cover with tiles" is recorded from late 14c.
tilt	tilt	"a joust, a combat," 1510s, perhaps from tilt (v.) on the notion of "to lean" into an attack, but the word originally seems to have been the name of the barrier which separated the combatants, which suggests connection with tilt in an earlier meaning "covering of coarse cloth, an awning" (mid-15c.), which is probably from tilt (v.), but perhaps related to or influenced by tent, or it may be from a Germanic source akin to O.E. beteldan "to cover." The verb is recorded from 1590s. Hence, also full tilt (c.1600).
timber	ˈtimbə	O.E. timber "building, structure," later "building material, trees suitable for building," and "wood in general," from P.Gmc. *temran (cf. O.Fris. timber "wood, building," O.H.G. zimbar "timber, wooden dwelling, room," O.N. timbr "timber," Ger. Zimmer "room"), from PIE *demrom-, from root *dem-/*dom- "build" (source of Gk. domos, L. domus; see domestic). The related Old English verb timbran, timbrian was the chief word for "to build" (cf. Du. timmeren, Ger. zimmern). As a call of warning when a cut tree is about to fall, it is attested from 1912 in Canadian English.

timorous	ˈtɪmərəs	mid-15c., from O.Fr. temeros (14c.), from M.L. timorosus "fearful," from L. timor "fear," from timere "to fear." Some early sense confused by mistaken identification with M.E. temerous "rash" (see temerity).

The whole Romanic word group is of uncertain origin; some think it is a shortening of the source of O.Fr. martirer "endure martyrdom" (see martyr).
tissue	ˈtisju:	mid-14c., "band or belt of rich material," from O.Fr. tissu "a ribbon, headband, belt of woven material" (c.1200), noun use of tissu "woven, interlaced," pp. of tistre "to weave," from L. texere "weave" (see texture). The biological sense is first recorded 1831, from Fr., introduced c.1800 by Fr. anatomist Marie-François-Xavier Bichal (1771-1802).

titular	ˈtɪtʃələ	1590s, perhaps by influence of M.Fr. titulaire, from L. titulus (see title).
toady	ˈtəʊdi:	"servile parasite," 1826, apparently shortened from toad-eater "fawning flatterer" (1742), originally referring to the assistant of a charlatan, who ate a toad (believed to be poisonous) to enable his master to display his skill in expelling the poison (1629).

Skt. darbhah "tuft of grass"). Fr. tourbe "turf" is a Germanic loan-word. The O.E. plural was identical with the singluar, but in M.E. turves sometimes was used. Slang meaning "territory claimed by a gang" is attested from 1953 in Brooklyn, N.Y.; earlier it had a jive talk sense of "the street, the sidewalk" (1930s), which is attested in hobo use from 1899, and before that "the work and venue of a prostitute" (1860). Turf war is recorded from 1962.

Attested earlier in English as a verb (1510s), though this now is obsolete.
turpitude	ˈtɜ:pɪˌtu:d	"depravity, infamy," late 15c., from M.Fr. turpitude (early 15c.), from L. turpitudinem (nom. turpitudo) "baseness," from turpis "vile, ugly, base, shameful," used in both the moral and the physical senses; of unknown origin. Perhaps originally "what one turns away from" (cf. L. trepit "he turns").
turquoise	ˈtɜ:ˌkwɔɪz	precious stone, 1560s, replacement from M.Fr. of M.E. turkeis, turtogis (late 14c.), from O.Fr. turqueise, fem. adj. "Turkish," in pierre turqueise "Turkish stone," so called because it was first brought to Europe from Turkestan or some other Turkish dominion (Sinai peninsula, according to one theory). Cognate with Sp. turquesa, M.L. (lapis) turchesius, M.Du. turcoys, Ger. türkis, Swed. turkos. As a color name, attested from 1853.

tuxedo	tʌkˈsi:dəʊ	man's evening dress for semiformal occasions, 1889, named for Tuxedo Park, N.Y., site of a country club where it first was worn in 1886. The name is an attractive subject for elaborate speculation, e.g.:  The Wolf tribe in New York was called in scorn by other Algonquians tuksit: round foot, implying that they easily fell down in surrender. In their region thus came the names Tuxedo and Tuxedo Lake, which were acquired by the Griswold family in payment of a debt. There the family established the exclusive Tuxedo Club, and there in the late 1880s Griswold Lorillard first appeared in a dinner jacket without tails, a tuxedo. By a twist of slang, one may now refer to a man in a tuxedo as a 'wolf. [Joseph T. Shipley, "The Origins of English Words," 1984]  But in another version of the story, p'tuksit was the Algonquian word for "wolf," the animal, perhaps from the shape of its paws. The authoritative Bright, however, says the tribe's name probably is originally a place name, perhaps Munsee Delaware (Algonquian) p'tuck-sepo "crooked river." Short form tux is attested from 1922.

twig	twiɡ	O.E. twigge, from P.Gmc. *twigan (cf. M.Du. twijch, Du. twijg, O.H.G. zwig, Ger. Zweig "branch, twig"), from the root of twi- (see twin), here meaning "forked" (as in O.E. twisel "fork, point of division").
twinge	twɪndʒ	1540s, "a pinch," from obsolete verb twinge "to pinch, tweak," from O.E. twengan "to pinch," of uncertain origin. Meaning "sharp, sudden pain" is recorded from c.1600. Figurative sense (with reference to shame, remorse, etc.) is recorded from 1620s.

twit	twɪt	1520s, aphetic form of atwite, from O.E. ætwitan "to blame, reproach," from æt "at" + witan "to blame," from P.Gmc. *witanan (cf. O.E. wite, O.S. witi, O.N. viti "punishment, torture;" O.H.G. wizzi "punishment," wizan "to punish;" Du. verwijten, O.H.G. firwizan, Ger. verweisen "to reproach, reprove," Goth. fraweitan "to avenge"), from PIE root *weid- "to see." For sense evolution, cf. L. animadvertere, lit. "to give heed to, observe," later "to chastise, censure, punish." The noun meaning "foolish, stupid and ineffectual person" is first attested 1934 in British slang, popular 1950s-60s, crossed over to U.S. with British sitcoms. It probably developed from the verb sense of "reproach" but may be influenced by nitwit.
twitch	twitʃ	late 12c., to-twic-chen "pull apart with a quick jerk," related to O.E. twiccian "to pluck," from P.Gmc. *twikjonan (cf. Low Ger. twicken, Du. twikken, O.H.G. gizwickan, Ger. zwicken "to pinch, tweak"). Related: Twitched; twitching. The noun is attested from 1520s.
tycoon	taɪˈku:n	1857, title given by foreigners to the shogun of Japan (said to have been used by his supporters when addressing foreigners, as an attempt to convey that the shogun was more important than the emperor), from Japanese taikun "great lord or prince," from Chinese tai "great" + kiun "lord." Transf. meaning "important person" is attested from 1861, in reference to U.S. president Abraham Lincoln (in Hay's diary); specific application to "businessman" is post-World War I. 
typhoid	ˈtaɪˌfɔɪd	1800, lit. "resembling typhus," from typhus + suffix from Gk. -oeides "like," from eidos "form, shape" (see -oid). The noun is from 1861, a shortened form of typhoid fever (1845), so called because it was originally thought to be a variety of typhus. Typhoid Mary (1909) was Mary Mallon (d.1938), a typhoid carrier who worked as a cook and became notorious after it was learned she had unwittingly infected hundreds in U.S.
typical	ˈtipikəl	c.1600, "symbolic, emblematic," from M.L. typicalis "symbolic," from L.L. typicus "of or pertaining to a type," from Gk. typikos, from typos "impression" (see type). Sense of "characteristic" is first recorded 1850. Related: Typically.

tyrant	ˈtaɪərənt	c.1300, "absolute ruler," from O.Fr. tyrant (12c.), from L. tyrannus "lord, master, tyrant" (cf. Sp. tirano, It. tiranno), from Gk. tyrannos "lord, master, sovereign, absolute ruler," a loan-word from a language of Asia Minor (probably Lydian); cf. Etruscan Turan "mistress, lady" (surname of Venus). In the exact sense, a tyrant is an individual who arrogates to himself the royal authority without having a right to it. This is how the Greeks understood the word 'tyrant': they applied it indifferently to good and bad princes whose authority was not legitimate. [Rousseau, "The Social Contract"]  The spelling with -t arose in O.Fr. by analogy with prp. endings in -ant. Fem. form tyranness is recorded from 1590 (Spenser); cf. M.L. tyrannissa (late 14c.).

ultramundane	ˌʌltrəˈmʌnˌdeɪn
umbrage	ˈʌmbrɪdʒ	early 15c., "shadow, shade," from M.Fr. ombrage "shade, shadow," from L. umbraticum, neut. of umbraticus "of or pertaining to shade," from umbra "shade, shadow," from PIE root *andho- "blind, dark" (cf. Skt. andha-, Avestan anda- "blind, dark"). Many figurative uses in 17c.; main remaining one is the meaning "suspicion that one has been slighted," first recorded 1610s; hence phrase to take umbrage at, attested from 1670s.
umpire	ˈʌmˌpaɪə	c.1400, noumper, from O.Fr. nonper "odd number, not even," in reference to a third person to arbitrate between two, from non "not" + per "equal," from L. par. Initial -n- lost by mid-15c. due to faulty separation of a noumpere, heard as an oumpere. Originally legal, the gaming sense first recorded 1714 (in wrestling).

Skt. vargah "division, group," Gk. eilein "to press, throng," M.Bret. gwal'ch "abundance," Welsh gwala "sufficiency, enough"). Meaning "coarse, low, ill-bred" is first recorded 1640s, probably from earlier use (with reference to people) with meaning "belonging to the ordinary class" (1530).

vying	ˈvaɪɪŋ
wacky	ˈwæki:	"crazy, eccentric," 1935, variant of whacky (n.) "fool," late 1800s British slang, probably ultimately from whack "a blow, stroke," from the notion of being whacked on the head one too many times.
waddle	ˈwɔdl	"to walk with short steps," 1590s, frequentative of wade. Related: Waddled; waddling. The noun is recorded from 1690s.
wade	weid	O.E. wadan "to go forward, proceed," in poetic use only, except as oferwaden "wade across," from P.Gmc. *wadan (cf. O.N. vaða, Dan. vade, O.Fris. wada, Du. waden, O.H.G. watan, Ger. waten "to wade"), from PIE root *wadh- "to go," found only in Germanic and Latin (cf. L. vadere "to go," vadum "shoal, ford," vadare "to wade"). The notion is of "to advance into water." It. guado, Fr. gué "ford" are Germanic loan-words. Originally a strong verb (p.t. wod, pp. wad); weak since 16c. Figurative sense of "to go into" (action, battle, etc.) is recorded from late 14c. Related: Waded; wading.
waffle	ˈwɔfəl	1744, from Du. wafel "waffle," from M.Du. or M.L.G. wafel; cognate with O.H.G. waba "honeycomb" (Ger. Wabe) and related to O.H.G. weban, O.E. wefan "to weave" (see weave). Sense of "honeycomb" is preserved in some combinations referring to a weave of cloth. Waffle iron is from 1794.
waft	wɑ:ft	1510s, "to carry over water," back-formation from obsolete wafter "convoy ship" (late 15c.), from M.Du. or M.L.G. wachter "a guard," from wachten "to guard," related to waken "rouse from sleep" (see wake (1)). The meaning "pass through air or space, float" is first attested 1704, and possibly shows some influence of northern dialect waff "cause to move to and fro" (1510s), a variant of wave. Related: Wafted; wafting.
wag	wæɡ	early 13c., probably from a Scandinavian source (cf. O.N. vagga "a cradle," Dan. vugge "rock a cradle," O.Swed. wagga "fluctuate"), and in part from O.E. wagian "move backwards and forwards;" all from P.Gmc. *wagojanan (cf. O.H.G. weggen, Goth. wagjan "to wag"), probably from PIE root *wegh- "to move about" (see weigh). Wagtail is attested from c.1500 as a kind of small bird; 18c. as "a harlot," but seems to be implied much earlier:  If therefore thou make not thy mistress a goldfinch, thou mayst chance to find her a wagtaile. [Lyly, "Midas," 1592]  Wag-at-the-wall (1825) was an old name for a hanging clock with pendulum and weights exposed.

wainscot	ˈweɪnskət	mid-14c., "imported oak of superior quality," probably from M.Du. or M.Flem. waghenscote "superior quality oak wood, board used for paneling" (though neither of these is attested as early as the English word), related to M.L.G. wagenschot (late 14c.), from waghen (see wagon) + scote "partition, crossbar." So called perhaps because the wood originally was used for wagon building and coachwork. Meaning "panels lining the walls of rooms" is recorded from 1540s. Wainscoting is from 1570s.
waive	weɪv	c.1300, from Anglo-Fr. weyver "to abandon, waive," O.Fr. weyver, guever "to abandon, give back," probably from a Scandinavian source akin to O.N. veifa "to swing about," from P.Gmc. *waibijanan (see waif). In M.E. legal language, used of rights, goods, or women. Related: Waived; waiving.
wallop	ˈwɔləp	late 14c., "to gallop," possibly from O.N.Fr. *waloper (13c.), probably from Frankish *walalaupan "to run well" (cf. O.H.G. wela "well" and Old Low Franconian loupon "to run, leap"). The verb meaning "to thrash" (1820) and the noun meaning "heavy blow" (1823) may be separate developments, of imitative origin.
wallow	ˈwɔləʊ	O.E. wealwian "to roll," from W.Gmc. *walwojan, from PIE *wal-, *wel- "to roll" (see vulva). Figurative sense of "to plunge and remain in some state or condition" is attested from early 13c. The noun is recorded from 1590s.
walrus	ˈwɔ:lrəs	1650s, from Du. walrus, which was probably a folk-etymology alteration (by influence of Du. walvis "whale" and ros "horse") of a Scandinavian word, such as O.N. rosmhvalr "walrus," hrosshvalr "a kind of whale," or rostungr "walrus." O.E. had horschwæl, and later morse, from Lapp morsa or Finnish mursu, which ultimately might be the source, much garbled, of the first element in O.N. rosmhvalr.
wan	wɔn	O.E. wann "dark, lacking luster," later "leaden, pale, gray," of uncertain origin, and not found in other Germanic languages. The connecting notion is colorlessness. Perhaps related to wane.
wanderlust	ˈwɔndəˌlʌst	1902, from Ger. Wanderlust, lit. "desire for wandering" (see wander + lust).
wane	weɪn	O.E. wanian "make or become smaller gradually," from P.Gmc. *wanojanan (cf.

Related: Waned; waning; wanes.
wangle	ˈwæŋgəl	"obtain something by trickery," 1888, originally British printer's slang for "fake by manipulation;" perhaps an alteration of waggle, or of wankle (now dial.) "unsteady, fickle," from O.E. wancol (see wench). Brought into wider use by World War I soldiers.
wanish	ˈvæniʃ
wanton	ˈwɔntən	c.1300, wan-towen, from M.E. privative prefix wan- "wanting, lacking" (from O.E. wan "wanting;" see wane) + togen, pp. of teon "to train, discipline;" lit. "to pull, draw," from P.Gmc. *teuhan (cf. O.H.G. ziohan "to pull;" see tug). The basic notion perhaps is "ill-bred, poorly brought up;" cf. Ger. ungezogen "ill-bred, rude, haughty," lit. "unpulled."  As Flies to wanton Boyes are we to th' Gods, They kill vs for their sport. [Shakespeare, "Lear," 1605]  Noun sense of "lascivious, lewd person" is attested from 1520s. The verb is recorded from 1580s. The only English survival of a once-common Germanic negating prefix still active in Dutch (cf. wanbestuur "misgovernment," wanluid "discordant sound"), German (wahn-), etc.
warden	ˈwɔ:dn	early 13c., "one who guards," from O.N.Fr. wardein, from Frankish *warding- (cf. O.Fr. guardenc), from *wardon "to watch, guard" (see ward (v.)). Meaning "governor of a prison" is recorded from c.1300.

Swed. vara, Dan. vare, O.Fris. were, M.Du. were, Du. waar, M.H.G., Ger. ware "goods"); related to O.E. wær "aware, cautious" (see wary). Usually wares, except in compounds such as hardware, earthenware, etc. Lady ware was a jocular 17c. euphemism for "a woman's private parts," and M.E. had ape-ware "deceptive or false ware; tricks" (mid-13c.).

The warp of fabric is that across which the woof is "thrown." Applied in 20c. astrophysics to the "fabric" of space-time, popularized in noun phrase warp speed by 1960s TV series "Star Trek."
warrant	ˈwɔrənt	early 13c., "protector, defender," from O.N.Fr. warant (O.Fr. garant), from Frankish *warand (cf. O.H.G. weren "to authorize, warrant," Ger. gewähren "to grant"), from P.Gmc. *war- "to warn, guard, protect," perhaps from PIE root *wer- "to cover" (cf. L. vereri "to observe with awe, revere, respect, fear;" Gk. ouros "watchman," horan "to see;" Hitt. werite- "to see;" see weir). Sense evolved via notion of "permission from a superior which protects one from blame or responsibility" (c.1300) to "document conveying authority" (1510s). A warrant officer in the military is one who holds office by warrant, rather than by commission.
warranty	ˈwɔrənti	mid-14c., legal term for various types of clauses in real estate transactions, from Anglo-Fr. and O.N.Fr. warantie (O.Fr. guarantie), from warant (see warrant (n.)).

washout	ˈwɔʃaut	"disappointing failure," 1902, from verbal phrase wash out "obliterate, cancel," attested from 1570s, hence colloquial sense of "to call off (an event) due to bad weather, etc."
waspish	ˈwɔspɪʃ	"irrascible, quick to take offense; spiteful," 1560s, from wasp + -ish. Related: Waspishly; waspishness.

waver	ˈweivə	late 13c., weyveren, "to show indecision," probably related to O.E. wæfre "restless, wavering," from P.Gmc. *wæbraz (cf. M.H.G. wabern "to waver," O.N. vafra "to hover about"), a frequentative form from the root of wave (v.). Related: Wavered; wavering.

weasel	ˈwi:zəl	"to deprive (a word or phrase) of its meaning," 1900, from weasel (n.); so used because the weasel sucks out the contents of eggs, leaving the shell intact; the sense of "extricate oneself (from a difficult place) like a weasel" is first recorded 1925; that of "to evade and equivocate" is from 1956. 
weird	wiəd	O.E. wyrd "fate, destiny" (n.), lit. "that which comes," from P.Gmc. *wurthis (cf.

For sense development from "turning" to "becoming," cf. phrase turn into "become." The modern sense of weird developed from M.E. use of weird sisters for the three fates or Norns (in Germanic mythology), the goddesses who controlled human destiny. They were usually portrayed as odd or frightening in appearance, as in "Macbeth," which led to the adj. meaning "odd-looking, uncanny," first recorded 1815.

Walh, Walah "Celt, Roman, Gaulish," and O.N. Valir "Gauls, Frenchmen" (Dan. vælsk "Italian, French, southern"); from P.Gmc. *Walkhiskaz, from a Celtic name represented by L. Volcæ (Caesar) "ancient Celtic tribe in southern Gaul." The word survives in Wales, Cornwall, Walloon, walnut, and in surnames Walsh and Wallace. Borrowed in O.C.S. as vlachu, and applied to Romanians, hence Wallachia. Among the English, Welsh was used disparagingly of inferior or substitute things, hence Welsh rabbit (1725), also perverted by folk-etymology as Welsh rarebit (1785).
